ABSTRACT

Context. Molecular maser lines are signposts of high-mass star formation, probing the excitation and kinematics of very compact
regions in the close environment of young stellar objects and providing useful targets for trigonometric parallax measurements.
Aims. Only a few NH3 (9,6) masers are known so far, and their origin is still poorly understood. Here we aim to find new NH3 (9,6)
masers to provide a better observational basis for studying their role in high-mass star-forming regions.
Methods. We carried out NH3 (9,6) observations toward Cepheus A and G34.26+0.15 with the Effelsberg 100-meter telescope (beam
size 49′′) and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA; beam size about 1′′.2).
Results. We discovered new NH3 (9,6) masers in Cep A and G34.26+0.15, which increases the number of known high-mass star-forming
regions hosting NH3 (9,6) masers from five to seven. Long-term monitoring (20 months) at Effelsberg shows that the intensity
of the (9,6) maser in G34.26+0.15 is decreasing, while the Cep A maser remains stable. Compared to the Effelsberg data and assuming
linear variations between the epochs of observation, the JVLA data indicate no missing flux. This suggests that the NH3 (9,6) emission
arises from single compact emission regions that are not resolved by the interferometric measurements. As JVLA imaging shows, the
NH3 (9,6) emission in Cep A originates from a sub-arcsecond-sized region, slightly to the west (0′′.28 ± 0′′.10) of the peak position
of the 1.36 cm continuum object, HW2. In G34.26+0.15, three NH3 (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is close to the head of the
cometary ultracompact H ii region C, and the other two are emitted from a compact region to the west of the hypercompact H ii region
A.
Conclusions. The newly found (9,6) masers appear to be related to outflows. The higher angular resolution of JVLA and very long
baseline interferometry observations are needed to provide more accurate positions and constraints for pumping scenarios.

1. Introduction

Since its discovery more than five decades ago (Cheung et al.
1968), ammonia (NH3) has been a most valuable molecule for
investigating the physical properties of molecular clouds (e.g.,
Ho & Townes 1983). While thermally excited transitions in
the centimeter-wavelength inversion transitions of ammonia are
regarded as a reliable thermometer of molecular clouds (e.g.,
Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983; Danby et al. 1988), ammonia
masers have attracted attention since the first detection of maser
action in the (J,K) = (3,3) metastable (J = K) line toward the
massive star-forming region W33 (Wilson et al. 1982). Subsequent
observations have led to the detection of new metastable
ammonia masers, including 15NH3 (3,3) (Mauersberger et al.
1986), NH3 (1,1) (Gaume et al. 1996), NH3 (2,2) (Mills et al.
2018), NH3 (5,5) (Cesaroni et al. 1992), NH3 (6,6) (Beuther

Cologne.

et al. 2007), NH3 (7,7), NH3 (9,9), and NH3 (12,12) (Henkel
et al. 2013). These have led to the discovery of metastable maser
lines in 22 different regions (Mauersberger et al. 1986, 1987;
Wilson & Henkel 1988; Wilson et al. 1990; Pratap et al. 1991;
Cesaroni et al. 1992; Wilson & Schilke 1993; Mangum & Wootten
1994; Kraemer & Jackson 1995; Zhang & Ho 1995; Zhang
et al. 1999; Walsh et al. 2007; Hunter et al. 2008; Galván-Madrid
et al. 2009; Brogan et al. 2011; Urquhart et al. 2011; Walsh
et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012; Henkel et al. 2013; Hoffman &
Joyce 2014; McEwen et al. 2016; Mills et al. 2018; Hogge et al.
2019; Mei et al. 2020; Towner et al. 2021). Compared with the
metastable ammonia masers, detected non-metastable (J > K)
ammonia maser transitions are more numerous. The first highly
excited non-metastable ammonia maser was detected by Madden
et al. (1986) in the (J,K) = (9,6) and (6,3) lines. Thereafter,
many other NH3 non-metastable inversion transition lines have
been identified as masers, including the (5,3), (5,4), (6,1), (6,2),
(6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) (7,6), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,3),
(9,4), (9,5), (9,7), (9,8), (10,7), (10,8), (10,9), and (11,9) transitions
(e.g., Mauersberger et al. 1987, 1988; Walsh et al. 2007;
Henkel et al. 2013; Mei et al. 2020). Except for the NH3 (3,3)
masers proposed to be associated with four supernova remnants
(McEwen et al. 2016), almost all the other ammonia masers are
detected in high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs). However,
while many HMSFRs host water (H2O), hydroxyl (OH),
or methanol (CH3OH) masers, ammonia masers are quite rare
in these sources, and the role that the environment of a young
high-mass star plays in their excitation remains unclear. Therefore,
dedicated searches for ammonia masers in HMSFRs are
indispensable in regard to their overall incidence and association
with different environments, which can provide additional
constraints on the pumping mechanism of ammonia masers.

So far, a total of 32 NH3 inversion transitions (∆K = 0
and ∆J = 0) have been identified as masers. Among these, and
despite arising from energy levels as high as 1090 K above
the ground state, the NH3 (9,6) maser stands out as being the
strongest and most variable one in W51-IRS2 (e.g., Henkel et al.
2013). Maser emission in this line has only been detected in five
HMSFRs, W51, NGC7538, W49, DR21 (OH) (Madden et al.
1986), and Sgr B2(N) (Mei et al. 2020). The NH3 (3,3) masers
are thought to be collisionally excited (e.g., Flower et al. 1990;
Mangum & Wootten 1994); in contrast, the pumping mechanism
of NH3 (9,6) masers is less well constrained (Madden et al.
1986). Brown & Cragg (1991) have studied ortho-ammonia and
found that it could possibly pump the (6,3) inversion line, but
they did not extend their model to the (9,6) transition due to the
fact that collision rates are only known for inversion levels up to
J = 6 (e.g., Danby et al. 1988).

NH3 (9,6) masers are found to be strongly variable, similar to
H2O masers (Madden et al. 1986; Pratap et al. 1991; Henkel et al.
2013). In W51-IRS2, Henkel et al. (2013) found that the (9,6)
line showed significant variation in line shape within a time interval
of only two days. Mapping of the (9,6) maser toward W51
with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) suggests that the
masers are closer to the H2O masers than to the OH masers or
to ultracompact (UC) H ii regions (Pratap et al. 1991). While
Henkel et al. (2013) and Goddi et al. (2015) showed that the SiO
and NH3 masers in W51-IRS2 are very close to each other, their
positions, differing by 0′′.065 (∼0.015 pc), do not fully coincide.

In this paper we report the discovery of NH3 (9,6) masers
in two HMSFRs, Cepheus A and G34.26+0.15. This increases
the number of (9,6) maser detections in our Galaxy from five
to seven. In Sect. 2 observations with the Effelsberg 100-meter
telescope and the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) are
described. Results are presented in Sect. 3. The morphology of
Cep A and G34.26+0.15 as well as a comparison of the emission
distributions of different tracers with the NH3 (9,6) masers are
presented in Sect. 4. Our main results are summarized in Sect. 5.

2. Observations and data reduction

2.1. Effelsberg observations and data reduction

The NH3 (9,6) line was observed toward Cep A and
G34.26+0.15 with the 100-meter Effelsberg telescope1 in 2020
January and 2021 February, July, and August. The S14mm double
beam secondary focus receiver was employed. The full width
at half maximum (FWHM) beam size is 49′′ at 18.5 GHz, the
frequency of the target line. The observations were performed in
position switching mode, and the off position was 10′ in azimuth

(Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie) at Effelsberg.

away from the source. For observations made before 2021 August,
we used a spectrometer that covered 2 GHz wide backends
with a channel width of 38.1 kHz, corresponding to ∼0.62 km s−1
at the line’s rest frequency, 18.49939 GHz (Poynter & Kakar
1975). A high spectral resolution backend with 65536 channels
and a bandwidth of 300 MHz was employed in 2021 August,
providing a channel width of 0.07 km s−1 at 18.5 GHz. Pointing
was checked every 2 hours using 3C 286 or NGC 7027.
Focus calibrations were done at the beginning of the observations
and during sunset and sunrise toward the abovementioned
pointing sources. The system temperatures were 100–130 K on
a main-beam brightness temperature, TMB, scale. This flux density
was calibrated assuming a TMB/S ratio of 1.95 K/Jy, derived
from continuum cross scans of NGC 7027 (the flux density was
adopted from Ott et al. 1994). Calibration uncertainties are estimated
to be ∼ 10%.

We used the GILDAS/CLASS2 package (Pety 2005) to reduce
the spectral line data. A first-order polynomial was subtracted
from each spectrum for baseline removal.

2.2. JVLA observations and data reduction

Observations of the NH3 (9,6) line toward Cep A and
G34.26+0.15 were obtained on 2021 July 13 with the JVLA
of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory3 (NRAO) in the
C configuration (project ID: 21A-157, PI: Yaoting Yan). We
employed 27 antennas for the observations. The primary beam
of the JVLA antennas is 150′′ (FWHM) at 18.5 GHz. A mixture
of mixed three-bit and eight-bit samplers were used to perform
the observations. For the NH3 (9,6) line observations, we
used one subband with the eight-bit sampler covering a bandwidth
of 16 MHz with full polarization, eight recirculations, and
four baseline board pairs (BIBPs) to provide a velocity range
of 260 km s−1 with a channel spacing of 0.13 km s−1. Two
additional subbands of bandwidth 16 MHz were used to cover
the NH3 (8,5) and (10,7) lines. The three-bit sampler with 32
subbands, each with a bandwidth of 128 MHz to cover a total
range of 4 GHz between 20–24 GHz, was used to measure
the continuum emission. 3C 286 with a flux density of
2.89 Jy at 18.5 GHz (Perley & Butler 2013) was used as a
calibrator for pointing, flux density, bandpass, and polarization.
J2230+6946 and J1851+0035 served as gain calibrators for Cep
A and G34.26+0.15, respectively. The on-source times were
4m30s and 4m50s toward Cep A and G34.26+0.15, respectively.

Data from two antennas were lost due to technical issues.
The data from the remaining 25 antennas were reduced
through the Common Astronomy Software Applications package
(CASA4; McMullin et al. 2007). We calibrated the data with
the JVLA CASA calibration pipeline using CASA 6.1.2. The
results were obtained after flagging data that contain artifacts.
We inspected the phase, amplitude, and bandpass variations of
the calibrated visibility data to search for additional artifacts before
imaging. Then, the uvcontsub task in CASA was used to
separate the calibrated visibilities into two parts, one with line-only
data and the other with the continuum data. The tclean task
with a cell size of 0′′.2 and Briggs weighting with robust=0 was
used to produce the images of spectral line and continuum emission.

P.A. = 58◦.79 and 1′′.33 × 1′′.06 at P.A. = 5◦.36 toward Cep A
and G34.26+0.15, respectively. For the 1.36 cm (20–24 GHz)
continuum emission, the synthesized beams are 1′′.08 × 0′′.67 at
P.A. = 60◦.64 and 0′′.95 × 0′′.71 at P.A. = 5◦.91 toward Cep A and
G34.26+0.15. The typical absolute astrometric accuracy of the
JVLA is ∼10% of the synthesized beam5. The flux density scale
calibration accuracy is estimated to be within 15%.

two dashed red lines at LSR velocities, VLSR, of −0.90 km s−1 and
−0.28 km s−1 indicate the central velocities of the two major components.
Right: NH3 (9,6) spectra from G34.26+0.15. The systemic velocity

red lines at VLSR = 54.1 km s−1, 55.8 km s−1, and 62.5 km s−1 show the
central velocities of the main ammonia emission components.

3. Results

The spectra from different epochs are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
Toward Cep A, the NH3 (9,6) line profile from the JVLA is extracted
from an Effelsberg-beam-sized region (FWHM, 49′′). In
the case of G34.26+0.15, the NH3 spectrum is below the noise
level if a similarly large beam size is used. Therefore, we derived
the JVLA NH3 (9,6) spectrum from a smaller region, with
radius 3′′.5, that contains all the detected NH3 (9,6) emission. In
Table A.1, the observed NH3 (9,6) line parameters obtained by
Gaussian fits are listed. NH3 (8,5) and (10,7) emission is not detected
by our JVLA observations. The 3σ upper limits for the
NH3 (8,5) and (10,7) lines toward Cep A are 23.2 mJy beam−1

and 27.2 mJy beam−1, respectively. In G34.26+0.15, the corresponding
3σ upper limits for the NH3 (8,5) and (10,7) lines are
22.1 mJy beam−1 and 30.4 mJy beam−1. For both sources, sensitivity
levels refer to emission from a single channel of width
0.13 km s−1. Taking the larger measured line widths of the (9,6)
maser features (see Table A.1), these limits could be further lowered
by factors of two to four.

3.1. Centimeter-continuum emission

The 1.36 cm continuum, derived from our JVLA observations,
toward Cep A is presented in Fig. 3. Six published compact
sources, HW2, HW3a, HW3b, HW3c, HW3d, and HW9, are detected
in our observations. Figure 4 shows the 1.36 cm continuum
in G34.26+0.15. Three main continuum objects, A, B, and
C, are detected. By using the imfit task in CASA, we measured
the continuum flux at 1.36 cm toward individual compact source
components in Cep A and G34.26+0.15. Details are given in Table
A.2.

3.2. NH3 (9,6) emission in Cep A

In 2020 January, NH3 (9,6) emission with a peak flux density of
0.67 ± 0.07 Jy was first detected with the Effelsberg 100-meter
telescope in Cep A. Emission with similar strength was also detected
in 2021 February and August with the same telescope.
Higher velocity resolution data, which were obtained in 2021
August, again with the Effelsberg 100-meter telescope, show
that the (9,6) emission contains two main velocity components.
Overall, the flux densities of the NH3 (9,6) emission line measured
with the Effelsberg 100-meter telescope are, within the calibration
uncertainties, unchanged. This is valid for the time interval
between 2020 January and August 2021, when we smoothed
the obtained spectra to the same velocity resolution. We also
see another two weaker components. Figure 2 emphasizes these
weak components with an expanded flux density scale.

Higher angular resolution data from the JVLA pinpoint the
position of the NH3 (9,6) emission with an offset of (−0′′.28,
0′′.02) relative to the 1.36 cm continuum peak of Cep A HW2
(Fig. 3). The deconvolved NH3 (9,6) component size is (0′′.29 ±
0′′.15)× (0′′.19± 0′′.14) at P.A. = 174◦, derived with the imfit task
in CASA, and can thus be considered, accounting for the uncertainties,
as unresolved.

and 110 × 0.125 mJy beam−1. The background image is the Spitzer 4.5 µm emission, taken from the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane
Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE; Benjamin et al. 2003; Churchwell et al. 2009). The reference position is αJ2000 = 22h56m17s.972, and
δJ2000 = 62◦01′49′′.587, the peak position of the continuum map, is marked with a black cross. Slightly to the west of the cross is the black
ellipse denoting the position of the NH3 (9,6) emission with a purple star at its center. OH (Bartkiewicz et al. 2005), H2O (Sobolev et al. 2018),
and CH3OH (Sanna et al. 2017) masers are presented as diamonds, circles, and squares, respectively. The color bar on the right-hand side indicates
the LSR velocity range of the maser spots.

150, 180, and 200 × 5.0 mJy beam−1. The background image is the Spitzer 4.5 µm emission, taken from GLIMPSE. The reference position is
αJ2000 = 18h53m18s.560, and δJ2000 = 01◦14′58′′.201, the peak position, is marked by a black cross. The black ellipses show the positions of NH3
(9,6) emissions with stars at their center (i.e., M1, M2, and M3). OH (Zheng et al. 2000), H2O (Imai et al. 2011), and CH3OH (Bartkiewicz et al.
2016) masers are presented as diamonds, circles, and squares, respectively. The color bar indicates the velocity range (VLSR) of maser spots.

In view of the constancy of the flux densities obtained at Effelsberg
and the similar JVLA flux density, measured in 2021
July, there is no missing interferometric flux density in the JVLA
data.

3.3. NH3 (9,6) emission in G34.26+0.15

The NH3 (9,6) emission was first detected toward G34.26+0.15
in 2020 January with the Effelsberg 100-meter telescope. Higher

velocity resolution data from 2021 August show the NH3 (9,6)
emission to be composed of two different components. The spectra
of weak components on a smaller flux density scale are presented
in Fig. 2.

Three different locations showing NH3 (9,6) emission are
found toward G34.26+0.15 (Fig. 4). The deconvolved NH3 (9,6)
component sizes are (1′′.42±0′′.43)× (0′′.54±0′′.62) at P.A. = 97◦
(M1), (0′′.42 ± 0′′.27) × (0′′.15 ± 0′′.27) at P.A. = 150◦ (M2), and

Y. T. Yan (闫耀庭) et al.: Discovery of ammonia (9,6) masers in two high-mass star-forming regions

(1′′.17 ± 0′′.34) × (0′′.27 ± 0′′.46) at P.A. = 53◦ (M3) and are thus
comparable to or smaller than the beam size.

Overall, the NH3 (9,6) line from G34.26+0.15 weakened
during the time interval from 2020 January to 2021 August by
about 70%. A comparison between the JVLA spectrum and the
Effelsberg data, assuming a linear decrease in the integrated intensity
as a function of time between different epochs of the
100-meter observations, suggests there is no missing flux in the
JVLA data. This is similar to the situation in Cep A.

4. Discussion

4.1. Morphology of Cep A and G34.26+0.15

Cep A, at a trigonometric parallax distance of 0.70±0.04 kpc
(Moscadelli et al. 2009; Dzib et al. 2011), is the second closest
HMSFR (after Orion) and by far the closest NH3 (9,6) maser
known. About 16 compact (∼1′′) radio sources (e.g., Hughes &
Wouterloot 1984; Hughes 1991; Garay et al. 1996) have been
identified in Cep A. Hughes & Wouterloot (1984) discovered
these targets at radio wavelengths, which are UC and hypercompact
(HC) H ii regions and/or stellar wind sources, subsequently
named as HW sources. The HW2 object is one of the best known
examples of a protostellar jet or disk system driving a powerful
outflow (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 1980; Güsten et al. 1984; Torrelles
et al. 1986; Curiel et al. 2006; Carrasco-González et al. 2021).
The observed NH3 (9,6) emission is slightly offset (−0′′.28, 0′′.02)
from the center of HW2 (see Fig. 3).

G34.26+0.15 is an HMSFR located at a distance of 3.3 kpc
(Kuchar & Bania 1994). It hosts four radio continuum components
named A, B, C, and D. Component C is a prototypical
cometary UC H ii region containing a compact head and a diffuse
tail that extends from east to west (e.g., Reid & Ho 1985; Garay
et al. 1986; Sewilo et al. 2004; Sewiło et al. 2011). Components
A and B are HC H ii regions, located to the east of component
C. An extended ring-like H ii region, called component D, is located
southeast of components A-C. One of the three observed
NH3 (9,6) emission line sources, M1, is close to the head of component
C, whereas M2 and M3 originate from another compact
region in the west of the HC H ii component A (see Fig. 4).

4.2. NH3 (9,6) emission possibly caused by maser action

As shown in Fig. 1, the NH3 (9,6) profiles in Cep A and
G34.26+0.15 are narrow (∆V1/2 ≤2.0 km s−1), much narrower
than the expected line widths (&4 km s−1) of thermal lines observed
at a similar angular resolution (e.g., Torrelles et al. 1985,
1986, 1993, 1999; Henkel et al. 1987; Comito et al. 2007; Mookerjea
et al. 2007; Wyrowski et al. 2012; Beuther et al. 2018). Velocity
shifts with respect to the systemic velocities of the two
sources are both observed, that is, V ∼10 km s−1 in Cep A and
V ∼4 km s−1 in G34.26+0.15 (see details in Sect. 4.3). Furthermore,
time variability is observed in the case of G34.26+0.15,
which is also a characteristic feature of maser emission.

Additional evidence of their maser nature is the high brightness
temperatures of the (9,6) emission spots toward Cep A and
G34.26+0.15. The spectral parameters are listed in Table A.3.
Because at least a significant part of the NH3 (9,6) emission
is not resolved by our JVLA observations, the derived brightness
temperatures are only lower limits. Nevertheless, the lower
limits on the brightness temperature are >800 K in Cep A (see
Table A.3), which is much higher than the expected thermal
gas temperature of ∼250 K (e.g., Patel et al. 2005; Comito
et al. 2007; Beuther et al. 2018). This strongly suggests that

the NH3 (9,6) emission in Cep A is due to maser action. Because
G34.26+0.15 is located at about five times the distance to
Cep A, beam dilution effects reduce the lower main beam brightness
temperature limit to 400 K in G34.26+0.15 (M2) (see Table
A.3). We also note that the luminosity of the NH3 (9,6) emission
in G34.26+0.15 is higher than or comparable to that in Cep
A, depending on the epoch of our observations.

Finally, the non-detections of the (8,5) and (10,7) lines also
indicate that the (9,6) line is special. This allows us to derive
lower 3σ limits of the (9,6)/(8,5) and (9,6)/(10,7) line intensity
ratios. The (9,6) line arises from ortho-NH3 (K = 3n), whereas
the NH3 (8,5) and (10,7) lines are para-NH3 (K , 3n) lines.
The minimum ortho-to-para ratios are in the range 12–42 and 1–
8 toward Cep A and G34.26+0.15, respectively. The statistical
weights for the ortho states are twice as large as those for the
para states (e.g., Umemoto et al. 1999; Goddi et al. 2011; Henkel
et al. 2013). In Cep A, the line intensity ratios are far higher than
this factor of two. Thus, at least in Cep A the higher main beam
brightness peak temperature of the (9,6) emission is caused by
maser action, perhaps involving exponential amplification, and
the case of G34.26+0.15 is likely similar.

4.3. Comparison of NH3 (9,6) masers with previously
published (quasi-)thermal NH3 emission

The metastable (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4) ammonia lines
show thermal emission toward Cep A over a velocity range of
−13 km s−1 ≤ VLSR ≤ −4 km s−1 (Brown et al. 1981; Güsten
et al. 1984; Torrelles et al. 1985, 1986, 1993, 1999). An average
NH3 column density of ∼5×1015 cm−2 was estimated for a region
of 3′′ around HW2 (Torrelles et al. 1999). This high NH3 abundance
could provide a suitable environment for maser species.
Large line widths (∆V1/2 '7.0 km s−1) with VLSR ∼ −10 km s−1
in both (1,1) and (2,2) lines were found toward HW2 (Torrelles
et al. 1993). The velocity is similar to the cloud’s systemic local
standard of rest (LSR) velocity of −11.2 km s−1, which
is based on CO (Narayanan & Walker 1996) and HCO+ observations
(Gómez et al. 1999). Our (9,6) maser is redshifted
(−0.9 km s−1 ≤ VLSR ≤2.9 km s−1) and shares positions with
the outflowing gas seen in CO and HCO+ with similarly redshifted
velocities. Therefore, we argue that the (9,6) masers are
related to outflowing gas.

In G34.26+0.15, a large NH3 column density,
1018.5±0.2 cm−2, and a kinetic temperature of 225±75 K
were derived by Henkel et al. (1987) based on measurements
of 15 NH3 inversion transitions in the frequency range of
22.0–26.0 GHz. These did not include the (9,6) transition.
While these lines were measured with a beam size of about
40′′, a comparison of the peak intensities of the optically thick
lines with the kinetic temperature reveals the size of the hot,
ammonia-emitting core to be only ∼2.5′′. All those measured
NH3 lines were quasi-thermal and had LSR velocities of
∼ 58.5 km s−1, close to the systemic velocity of ∼ 58.1 km s−1
obtained from C17O observations (Wyrowski et al. 2012).
Their line widths (∆V1/2 ≥3.6 km s−1) are larger than what
we find (0.35 km s−1 ≤ ∆V1/2 ≤ 0.94 km s−1) for each (9,6)
maser component (see details in Table A.3). In all, we may
have observed four different (9,6) velocity features. Three
are blueshifted at VLSR ∼ 53.8 km s−1, 55.8 km s−1, and
56.8 km s−1, and a fourth, tentatively detected, at 62.5 km s−1.
This tentative redshifted feature was only potentially detected
with Effelsberg in 2020 January. The velocity is similar to that
of the JVLA measurements on the NH3 (1,1) absorption line
against continuum source C (∼ 7′′ resolution; Keto et al. 1987)
and the NH3 (3,3) emission surrounding continuum source B as
well as the head of C (1′′.4×1′′.2 resolution; Heaton et al. 1989).
However, we did not find this redshifted component in our
JVLA observations. Therefore, its position within G34.26+0.15
cannot be determined. The blueshifted (9,6) masers with a
velocity range of 53.8–56.8 km s−1 (M1, M2, and M3) show
velocities compatible with those of the NH3 (3,3) emission at
the proper positions (Heaton et al. 1989), which might be a
suitable environment for maser species.

4.4. Comparison of NH3 (9,6) masers with other maser lines

To characterize the environment of NH3 (9,6) masers, we can
compare their positions with respect to those of other maser
species (i.e., OH, H2O, and CH3OH). Toward Cep A HW2,
many CH3OH (e.g., Menten 1991; Sugiyama et al. 2008; Sanna
et al. 2017) and H2O maser spots (e.g., Torrelles et al. 1998,
2011; Sobolev et al. 2018) are detected and are associated with
its disk. Sobolev et al. (2018) also found that most of the H2O
maser flux is associated with the compact H ii region HW3d. OH
maser features close to the H ii regions are also seen in HW2
(e.g., Cohen & Brebner 1985; Bartkiewicz et al. 2005). These
three kinds of masers in Cep A have a large velocity range of
−25 km s−1 ≤ VLSR ≤ −2 km s−1 and are widespread around
HW2 and HW3, while NH3 (9,6) emission is only detected at
−0.9 km s−1 ≤ VLSR ≤2.9 km s−1 toward a sub-arcsecond-sized
 region to the west of the peak continuum position of HW2
(see Fig. 3). This suggests that the NH3 (9,6) maser in Cep A
is unique and not related to maser spots seen in other molecular
species.

In G34.26+0.15, OH (Zheng et al. 2000), H2O (Imai et al.
2011), and CH3OH (Bartkiewicz et al. 2016) masers have been
detected east of source C (Fig. 4), and none of them coincides
with the head of C. The NH3 (9,6) maser M1 is also found
slightly off the head of source C. This could suggest that M1
is powered by continuum source C or by an outflow. Near component
B, there are some OH and CH3OH masers but no H2O
or NH3 masers. A group of H2O masers, well-known tracers
of outflows, with a large velocity distribution of 43 km s−1 ≤
VLSR ≤54 km s−1, was found to the west of the centimeter-continuum
source A and close to the peak of the millimeter-continuum
emission (see details in our Fig. A.2 and also in Fig. 5
of Imai et al. 2011). The closeness of NH3 (9,6) maser spots M2
and M3 to this group of water masers and their similar velocities
again suggest an association of NH3 (9,6) masers with outflow
activity.

4.5. Constraints on pumping scenarios

Our observations have resulted in the detection of NH3 (9,6)
masers in Cep A and G34.26+0.15. The new detections could
provide additional constraints on the maser line’s pumping
mechanism. As mentioned in Sect. 1, the pumping mechanism
of the (9,6) maser is unclear (Madden et al. 1986; Brown &
Cragg 1991). Previous studies have suggested that there are three
main pumping scenarios to explain the observed NH3 maser
lines (Madden et al. 1986; Henkel et al. 2013): (1) infrared radiation
from the dust continuum emission, (2) line overlap, and
(3) collisional pumping.

For the first mechanism, infrared photons near 10 µm are
needed for vibrational excitation. The high dust temperature
(∼300 K) of W51-IRS2 can provide substantial infrared photons
near 10 µm, which is used for radiative pumping (Henkel

et al. 2013). Both Cep A and G34.26+0.15 have similar kinetic
temperatures of &200 K (Henkel et al. 1987; Patel et al. 2005;
Comito et al. 2007; Beuther et al. 2018). This suggests that
high kinetic temperatures are needed to excite NH3 (9,6) masers.
However, it should be noted that the silicate dust absorption feature
might dominate at 10 µm (see the spectral energy distribution
of Cep A in De Buizer et al. 2017). Additionally, there is
no bright infrared emission around the two (9,6) masers, M2 and
M3, in G34.26+0.15 (see Fig. 4; see also Fig. 11 in De Buizer
et al. 2003 for a 10.5 µm map). This indicates that the pumping
mechanism via infrared photons near 10 µm may not be viable
to explain the (9,6) masers in Cep A and G34.26+0.15. Furthermore,
Wilson & Schilke (1993) argued that radiative pumping by
dust emission tends to excite multiple adjacent ammonia maser
transitions, which appears to contradict our failure to detect the
adjacent (8,5) and (10,7) lines (with respect to quantum numbers
and frequency) and to only measure the (9,6) transitions in Cep
A and G34.26+0.15. Therefore, we suggest that infrared radiation
from dust is not the main pumping source.

Madden et al. (1986) suggested that there might be some
line overlaps between the rotational NH3 transitions in the far-infrared
band. However, this would be unlikely to affect only the
(9,6) line. Nevertheless, far-infrared spectral observations will
be needed to clarify this scenario.

Based on our observations, the (9,6) maser spots are close
to, but not coincident with, the peaks of the radio continuum
emission in Cep A and G34.26+0.15. Furthermore, the (9,6)
masers show velocity offsets with respect to their systemic velocities.
This indicates that the (9,6) masers are located at the
base of outflows, similar to the H2O masers. This is supported
by VLBI observations that show that (9,6) masers tend to be
closely associated with H2O masers (Pratap et al. 1991). The observed
time variability in G34.26+0.15 and W51-IRS2 can also
be attributed to episodic molecular outflows. This indicates that
collisional pumping could be the driver of the (9,6) maser. On
the other hand, collisional pumping has been successfully used
to explain the NH3 (3,3) maser (Walmsley & Ungerechts 1983;
Flower et al. 1990; Mangum & Wootten 1994). Collisions tend to
pump from the K=0 level to the K=3 level with parity changes,
that is, the upper level of the (3,3) metastable transition will be
overpopulated. NH3 (9,6) arises from the ortho species, so a similar
mechanism might also occur in the case of the (9,6) transition.
Further measurements of collisional rates of ammonia will
allow us to test this scenario.

5. Summary

We report the discovery of NH3 (9,6) masers in two HMSFRs,
Cep A and G34.26+0.15. The narrow line width of the emission
features (∆V1/2 ≤2.0 km s−1) and their high brightness temperatures
(> 400 K) indicate the maser nature of the lines.
The intensity of the (9,6) maser in G34.26+0.15 is decreasing
with time, while toward Cep A the maser is stable based on 20
months of monitoring at Effelsberg. Linearly interpolating the
integrated intensities obtained at Effelsberg as a function of time,
the JVLA measurements show that there is no missing flux density
on scales on the order of 1.2 arcsec (4 ×10−3 and 2 ×10−2 pc)
to the total single-dish flux. The JVLA-detected emission indicates
that the NH3 (9,6) maser in Cep A originates from a
sub-arcsecond-sized region slightly (0′′.28 ± 0′′.10) to the west
of the peak position of the 1.36 cm continuum object, HW2. In
G34.26+0.15, three NH3 (9,6) maser spots are observed: one is
close to the head of the cometary UC H ii region C, and the other
two are emitted from a compact region to the west of the HC H ii
region A. We suggest that the (9,6) masers may be connected to
outflowing gas. Higher angular resolution JVLA and VLBI observations
are planned to provide more accurate positions and
constraints on pumping scenarios.

Notes. The spectral parameters are obtained from Gaussian fitting. (a) The JVLA spectrum toward Cep A is extracted from the Effelsberg-beam-sized
region (FWHM 49′′). (b) For G34.26+0.15, the JVLA beam samples the NH3 (9,6) spectrum over a region of radius 3′′.5, which contains all
detected NH3 (9,6) emissions.

Fig. A.1. Cepheus A. The grey shaded areas mark the 1.36 cm JVLA continuum map of Cep A. The reference position is αJ2000 = 22h56m17s.972,
and δJ2000 = 62◦01′49′′.587, the peak position of the continuum map, is marked by a red cross. Slightly to the west of the cross is the white ellipse
denoting the position of the NH3 (9,6) emission with a purple star at its center. The red contours show the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array
(NOEMA) 1.37 mm continuum, taken from Beuther et al. (2018). Contour levels are -5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, and 200 × 2.43 mJy beam−1.
OH (Bartkiewicz et al. 2005), H2O (Sobolev et al. 2018), and CH3OH (Sanna et al. 2017) masers are presented as diamonds, circles, and squares,
respectively. The color bar on the right-hand side indicates the velocity range (VLSR) of maser spots.
