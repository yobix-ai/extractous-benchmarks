ABSTRACT

Most stellar evolution models predict that black holes (BHs) should not exist above approximately

50−70 M⊙. However, recent LIGO/Virgo detections indicate the existence of BHs with masses at and
above this threshold. We suggest that massive BHs, including intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs),

can form in galactic nuclei through collisions between stellar-mass black holes and the surrounding

main-sequence stars. Considering dynamical processes such as collisions, mass segregation, and relaxation,
we find that this channel can be quite efficient, forming IMBHs as massive as 104 M⊙. Our
results suggest that massive black holes and IMBHs may be ubiquitous in galactic centres. This formation
channel also has implications for observations. Collisions between stars and BHs can produce
electromagnetic signatures, for example, from x-ray binaries and tidal disruption events. Additionally,
formed through this channel, both black holes in the mass gap and IMBHs can merge with the supermassive
black hole at the center of a galactic nucleus through gravitational waves. These gravitational
wave events are extreme and intermediate mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs and IMRIs, respectively).

1. INTRODUCTION

The recently detected gravitational wave source
GW190521 (The LIGO Scientific Collaboration et al.
2020a,b) produced an intermediate mass black hole of
approximately 142 M⊙. This event may have also had a
85 M⊙ progenitor, which falls within the pair-instability
mass gap that limits stellar black holes (BHs) to no
more than ∼< 50 M⊙ (e.g., Heger et al. 2003; Woosley
2017)1. Similarly, the merger products of GW150914,
GW170104, and GW170814 fall within the mass gap
(e.g., Abbott et al. 2016, 2017a,b). BH mergers that
form second generation BHs and, in some cases, intermediate
mass BHs (IMBHs), these gravitational wave
(GW) events can occur in globular clusters, young stellar
clusters, or the field (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2018; Rodriguez
et al. 2019; Fishbach et al. 2020; Mapelli et al.

2021b,a; Di Carlo et al. 2019, 2021; Dall’Amico et al.

2021; Arca Sedda et al. 2021). However, IMBHs are

not limited to these locations and may reside in galactic
nuclei as well. Several studies propose that our
own galactic center may host an IMBH in the inner pc

metallicity of the progenitor (e.g., Woosley 2017; Spera & Mapelli
2017a; Limongi & Chieffi 2018a; Sakstein et al. 2020; Belczynski
et al. 2020a; Renzo et al. 2020; Vink et al. 2021).

(e.g., Hansen & Milosavljević 2003; Maillard et al. 2004;

Gürkan & Rasio 2005; Gualandris & Merritt 2009; Chen

& Liu 2013; Generozov & Madigan 2020; Fragione et al.

2020a; Zheng et al. 2020; Naoz et al. 2020; GRAVITY

Collaboration et al. 2020).

Several IMBH formation channels have been suggested
in the literature. For example, IMBHs may have a cosmological
origin, forming in the early universe either
as a result of the very first stars (e.g., Madau & Rees
2001; Schneider et al. 2002; Johnson & Bromm 2007;
Valiante et al. 2016) or from direct collapse of accumulated
gas (e.g., Begelman et al. 2006; Yue et al. 2014;
Ferrara et al. 2014; Choi et al. 2015; Shlosman et al.
2016). These high redshift IMBHs would need to survive
galaxy evolution and mergers to present day (e.g.,
Rashkov & Madau 2014), with significant effects on their
stellar and even dark matter surroundings (e.g., Bertone
et al. 2009; Chen & Liu 2013; Bringmann et al. 2012; Eda
et al. 2013; Naoz & Silk 2014; Naoz et al. 2019). Another
popular formation channel relies on the coalescence of
many stellar-mass black holes. For example, IMBHs
may form in the centers of globular clusters, where few-body
interactions lead to the merger of stellar-mass BHs
(e.g., O’Leary et al. 2006; Gürkan et al. 2006; Blecha
et al. 2006; Freitag et al. 2006; Umbreit et al. 2012; Rodriguez
et al. 2018; Rodriguez et al. 2019; Fragione et al.
2020b). Other formation mechanisms invoke successive
collisions and mergers of massive stars (e.g., Portegies
Zwart & McMillan 2002; Portegies Zwart et al. 2004;
Freitag et al. 2006; Kremer et al. 2020; González et al.
2021; Di Carlo et al. 2021).

The main obstacle to sequential BH mergers in clusters
is that the merger recoil velocity kick often exceeds
the escape velocity from the cluster (e.g., Schnittman
& Buonanno 2007; Centrella et al. 2010; O’Leary et al.
2006; Baibhav et al. 2020, Rom & Sari, in prep.). However,
nuclear star clusters at the centers of galaxies do
not encounter this problem. For example, Fragione et al.
(2021) explore repeated BH-BH mergers in nuclear star
clusters without a SMBH. They considered BH binary-single
interactions, binary BH GW merger, and GW
merger recoil kicks. The post-kick merger product sinks
back towards the cluster center over a dynamical friction
timescale. Using this approach, they showed that
103 − 104 M⊙ IMBHs can form efficiently over the life-time
of a cluster.

However, as discussed in Section 2.2, direct star-BH
collisions are much more frequent than BH-BH collision
in galactic nuclei, making the former a promising channel
for BH growth. We propose that IMBHs can form
naturally within the central pc of a SMBH in a galactic
center. Specifically, these IMBHs form through repeated
collisions with main sequence stars, accreting some or
all of the star’s mass depending on the details of the
collision. We demonstrate that this channel can create
IMBHs with masses as large as 104 M⊙, depending on
the density profile of the surrounding stars.

The paper is structured as follows: we describe relevant
physical processes and our approach in Section 2.

In particular, we provide an overview of collisions in
Section 2.2 and present our statistical approach in Section
2.3. Section 2.4 discusses our treatment of the
mass growth with each collision and presents analytic
solutions to our equations in two different regimes, efficient
collisions and inefficient collisions We compare
these solutions to our statistical results. Sections 2.5
and 2.7 discuss implications for GW merger events between
IMBHs and the SMBH. We then incorporate relaxation
processes and discuss the subsequent results in
Section 2.8. Finally, we discuss and summarize our findings
in Section 3.

2. METHODOLOGY

We consider a population of stellar mass BHs embedded
in a cluster of 1 M⊙ stars. When stars and BHs
collide, the BHs can accrete mass. The growth rate depends
on the physical processes outlined below. We use
a statistical approach to estimate the stellar encounters
and final IMBH masses.

2.1. Physical Picture

We consider a population of BHs within the inner few
parsecs of the SMBH in a galactic nucleus (GN). We assume
that the BH mass distribution follows that of the
stars from which they originate, a Kroupa initial mass
function dN/dm ∝ m−2.35. While this choice represents
a gross oversimplification, it has very little bearing on
our final results. Future work may address the particulars
of the BH mass distribution, but we do not expect
that it will significantly alter the outcome. The upper
and lower limits of the BH mass distribution are 5 and
50M⊙, respectively. We select the upper limit to encompass
the range of upper bounds predicted by stellar
evolution models, which vary between 40 and 125M⊙
depending on the metallicity (Heger et al. 2003; Woosley
2017; Spera & Mapelli 2017b; Limongi & Chieffi 2018b;
Belczynski et al. 2020b; Renzo et al. 2020). We assume
that the orbits of the BHs follow a thermal eccentricity
distribution. We draw their semimajor axes, a•, from a
uniform distribution in log distance, dN/d(log r) being
constant. While this distribution is not necessarily representative
of actual conditions in the GN, we use it to
build a comprehensive physical picture of BH growth at
all distances from the SMBH, including within 0.01 pc.

Otherwise, the innermost region of the GN would be
poorly represented in our sample. We consider other
observationally motivated distributions in Section 2.8,
but reserve a more detailed examination of the distribution’s
impact for future work.

2.2. Direct Collisions

BHs in the GN can undergo direct collisions with other
objects. The timescale for this process, tcoll, can be estimated
using a simple rate calculation: t−1coll = nσA,
where n is the number density of objects, σ is the velocity
dispersion, and A is the cross-section. We use the
collision timescale from Rose et al. (2020):

t−1coll =πn(a•)σ(a•)

×(
f1(e•)r

2
c + f2(e•)rc

2G(mBH +m⋆)

σ(a•)2

)
. (1)

where G is the gravitational constant and rc is the sum
of the radii of the interacting objects, a black hole with
mass mBH and a star with mass m⋆. Detailed in Rose
et al. (2020), f1(e•) and f2(e•) account for the effect of
the eccentricity of the BH’s orbit about the SMBH on
the collision rate, while n and σ are simply evaluated
at the semimajor axis of the orbit (see below). Note
that this timescale equation includes the effects of gravitational
 focusing, which enhances the cross-section of
interaction.


Figure 1. We plot the relevant timescales, including collision
 (green), relaxation (gold), and BH-BH GW capture
(purple), for a single BH in the GN as a function of distance
from the SMBH. For the collision timescale, we assume the
BH is on a circular orbit. The timescales depend on the
density, so we adopt a range of density profiles, bounded by
α = 1 (dashed curve) to α = 2 (dark, solid curve). The dark
blue line represents the time for a 105 M⊙ BH to merge with
the SMBH through GW emission.


Assuming a circular orbit for simplicity, we plot the
timescale for a BH orbiting in the GN to collide with
a 1M⊙ star as a function of distance from the SMBH
in Figure 1.2 As this timescale depends on the density
of surrounding stars, we adopt a density profile of the
form:

ρ(r•) = ρ0

(
r•
r0

)−α
, (2)

where r• denotes the distance from the SMBH. We adopt

a SMBH mass of 4× 106 M⊙ such that our fiducial GN
matches our own galactic center (e.g., Ghez et al. 2005;

Genzel et al. 2003). In this case, the normalization in

Eq. (2) is ρ0 = 1.35× 106M⊙/pc3 at r0 = 0.25 pc (Genzel
et al. 2010). Additionally, in Eq. (2), α gives the

slope of the power law. We assume that a uniform pop

ulation of solar mass stars account for most of the mass

in the GN, making the stellar number density:

n(r•) =
ρ(r•)

1M⊙
. (3)

2 We note that the eccentricity has a very minor effect on the
collision timescale (Rose et al. 2020).

The collision timescale also depends on the velocity dispersion,
which we express as:

σ(r•) = √GM• r•(1 + α), (4)

where α is the slope of the density profile and M• denotes
the mass of the SMBH (Alexander 1999; Alexander
& Pfuhl 2014). As mentioned above, Eq. (1) depends
on the sum of the radii of the colliding objects, rc. We
take rc = 1R⊙ because these interactions involve a BH
and a star, and the former has a much smaller physical
cross-section. For example, the Schwarzschild radius
of a 10M⊙ BH is only 30 km, or 4.31 × 10−5R⊙. For
this reason, direct collisions between compact objects
are very rare and not included in our model.

We note that direct collisions between BHs, via GW
emission, were shown to be efficient in nuclear star clusters
without SMBHs (e.g., Portegies Zwart & McMillan
2000; O’Leary et al. 2006; Rodriguez et al. 2016).

However, in the GN, star-BH collisions are much more
frequent than direct BH-BH collisions. As depicted in
Figure 1, the star-BH collision timescale for a range
of density profiles is many orders of magnitude shorter
than the BH-BH GW collision timescale (for the relevant
equations, see O’Leary et al. 2009; Gondán et al.
2018, for example). Thus, we expect that star-BH collisions
will be the main driver of IMBH growth in the

GN.

2.3. Statistical Approach to Collisions

We simulate the mass growth of a population of BHs
with initial conditions detailed in Section 2.1. Over an
increment ∆t of 106 yr, we calculate the probability of
a collision occurring, given by ∆t/tcoll. This choice of
∆t is motivated by our galactic center’s star formation
timescale (e.g., Lu et al. 2009), allowing for regular replenishment
of the stellar population in the GN. We have
checked that the results are not sensitive to this choice
of ∆t, omitted here to avoid clutter. We draw a number
between 0 and 1 using a random number generator. If
that number is less than or equal to the probability, we
increase the BH’s mass by ∆m, the mass that the BH is
expected to accrete in a single collision (see Section 2.4
for details). We recalculate the collision timescale using
the updated BH mass and repeat this process until the
time elapsed equals the simulation time of 10 Gyr3.

3 Closer to the SMBH, ∆t may exceed the collision timescale by
a factor of a few for steep density profiles. We include a safeguard
in our code which takes the ratio tcoll/∆t and rounds it
to the nearest integer. We take this integer to be the number of
collisions and increase the BH mass accordingly.


2.4. Mass Growth

When a BH collides with a star, it may accrete material
and grow in mass. The details of the accretion
depend on the relative velocity between the BH and
star. For simplicity, this calculation assumes that the
two objects experience a head on collision, with the BH
passing through the star’s center. We begin by considering
the escape velocity from the BH at the star’s
outermost point, its surface, which corresponds to the
maximum impact parameter 1 R⊙. Qualitatively, one
might expect that the BH could accrete the entire star
(i.e., ∆m ∼ 1 M⊙) if the relative velocity is smaller than
the escape velocity from the BH at this point. However,
in the vicinity of the SMBH, the dispersion velocity of
the stars may be much larger than the escape velocity
from the BH at the star’s surface. In this case, the BH
accretes a “tunnel” of material through the star. This
tunnel has radius equal to the Bondi radius and length
approximately 1R⊙.

To estimate ∆m, we begin with the Bondi-Hoyle accretion
rate, ṁ, given by:

ṁ =4πG2m2BHρstar (c2s + σ2) 3/2, (5)

where cs is the speed of sound in the star and ρstar is its
density (e.g., Bondi 1952; Bondi & Hoyle 1944; Shima
et al. 1985; Edgar 2004, see latter for a review). We
approximate the density as 1M⊙/(4πR
3
⊙/3) and take

the conservative value of cs = 500 km s
−1, which is

consistent with the sound speed inside a 1 M⊙ star

(Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. 1996) and allows us to set
a lower limit on ∆m. To find ∆m, at each collision, we
have:

∆m = min(ṁ× t⋆,cross, 1 M⊙) , (6)
where t⋆,cross ∼ R⊙/σ is the crossing time of the BH in
the star. We take the minimum between ṁ× t⋆,cross and
1 M⊙ because the BH cannot accrete more mass than

one star at each collision.

Figure 2 juxtaposes the expected growth using Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion (blue small points) with a
much simpler model in which the BH accretes the star’s
entire mass, 1M⊙ (red large points). Both examples
start with identical populations of 10M⊙ BHs (grey)
and simulate growth through collisions using a statistical
approach. As the BHs grow, the collision timescale,
which depends on mBH, decreases. Simultaneously,
∆m, which also depends on mBH, increases. The result
is exponential growth (see discussion and details
surrounding Eq. (8)). In Figure 2, however, the simulations
assume α = 1 for the stellar density profile, ensuring
the collision timescale is long compared to the simulation
time, 10 Gyr. Therefore, the BHs grow slowly,

Figure 2. We consider an example that highlights the mass
growth as a function of distance from the SMBH. Grey dots
represent the initial masses and distances from the SMBH
of the BHs involved in the simulation. For simplicity, we set
the inital mass equal to 10M⊙ for all of the BHs. Assuming
the density profile of stars has α = 1, we consider two cases:
BHs accrete all of the star’s mass during a collision (red) and
only a portion of the star’s mass is accreted during a collision
given by Eq. 6 (blue). The latter case results in less growth
closer to the SMBH where the velocity dispersion becomes
high. The shaded regions and dashed lines represent the
analytical predictions detailed in Section 2.4.
and their final masses can be approximated using the
following equation:

mfinal(tcoll → const.) =minitial + ∆m T tcoll, (7)

in which T represents the simulation time and ∆m and

tcoll remain constant, approximated as their initial values.


This equation is plotted in Figure 2 for both cases,
∆m = 1M⊙ (red) and ∆m from Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion (blue), and the curves coincide with the corresponding
simulated results. The shaded regions represent
one standard deviation from Eq. (7), calculated
using the square root of the number of collisions, T/tcoll.

As indicated by the results in red, in the absence of
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion, the BHs closest to the
SMBH experience the most growth because they have
shorter collision timescales. However, Bondi-HoyleLyttleton
accretion becomes important closer to the
SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is large compared
with the stars’ escape velocity, and curtails the mass
growth for BHs in this region. Outside of 10−2 pc, a BH
consumes the star’s entire mass: the accretion-limited
∆m governed by Eq. (7) is greater than or equal to the
star’s mass.

Eq. 7 does not apply for other values of α. When the
collision timescale is shorter, corresponding to a larger
index α in the density profile (see Figure 1), the growth
is very efficient and ∆m quickly approaches 1 M⊙. Consequently,
while we can now assume ∆m = 1 M⊙, we
can no longer assume the collision timescale is constant.

The final mass grows exponentially as a result. For
∆m = 1M⊙, the general solution is reached by solving
the differential equation dm/dt = 1M⊙/tcoll(m), which
gives:

mfinal(∆m→ 1 M⊙) =−A+ (minitial +A) eCT (8)

where A = σ2Rstar/G and C = 2πGnstarRstar/σ. As an

example, we plot this curve in purple for the α = 2 case,
in Figure 3, which agrees with the simulated masses.

2.5. GW Inspiral

When a BH is close to the SMBH, GW emission can
circularize and shrink its orbit. We implement the effects
of GW emission on the BH’s semimajor axis and

eccentricity following Peters & Mathews (1963a). The
characteristic timescale to merge a BH with an SMBH
is given by:

tGW ≈2.9× 1012 yr
(

M•
106 M⊙

)−1(
mBH

106 M⊙

)−1
×
(
M• +mBH
2× 106 M⊙

)−1(
a•

10−4 pc

)4
× f(e•)(1− e2•)

7/2 , (9)

where f(e•) is a function of e•. For all values of e•,
f(e•) is between 0.979 and 1.81 (Blaes et al. 2002). We

plot this timescale for a 1 × 105M⊙ BH in Figure 1 in
blue.

In our simulations, we assume a BH has merged with
the SMBH when the condition tGW < telapsed is met.
When this condition is satisfied, we terminate mass
growth through collisions for that BH.4

2.6. IMBH growth

As detailed above, BH-stellar collisions can increase
the BH masses as a function of time. Here, we examine
the sensitivity of the BH growth to the density power
law. From Eq. (1), it is clear that the growth rate depends
on the stellar density profile, governed by the index
α. We expect that higher values of α, or steeper
profiles, will result in more efficient mass growth. In
Figure 1, larger values of α lead to collision timescales
in the GN’s inner region, inwards of 0.25 pc, that are
4 For comparison, we also incrementally changed the semimajor
axis and eccentricity from GW emission following the equations
in Peters & Mathews (1963b). This method leads to a slight
increase in the final IMBH masses because it accounts for the
collisions that take place while the orbit is gradually shrinking.

much smaller that the 10 Gyr simulation time. Figure 3
confirms this expectation. It depicts the mass growth of
a uniform distribution of BHs with initial conditions detailed
in Section 2.1 for five α values, spanning 1 (green)
to 2 (purple). The most massive IMBHs form inwards
of 0.25 pc for the α = 2 case.

2.7. Gravitational Wave Mergers and Intermediate

and Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral Candidates

Towards the SMBH, efficient collisions can create BHs
massive enough to merge with the SMBH through GWs.

Following the method detailed in Section 2.5, when a
given BH meets the criterion tGW < telapsed, we mark
it as merged with the SMBH. We assume that at this
point the dynamics of the BH will be determined by GW

emission, shrinking and circularizing the BHs orbit until
it undergoes an extreme or intermediate mass ratio

inspiral (EMRI and IMRI, respectively). The righthand
plot in Figure 3 shows the BH masses versus time of
merger. It is interesting to note that even in the absence
of relaxation processes, which are often invoked
to explain the formation of EMRIs, EMRIs and notably
IMRIs can form in this region.

2.8. Two Body Relaxation Processes

A BH orbiting the SMBH experiences weak gravitational
interactions with other objects in the GN. Over a
relaxation time, these interactions alter its orbit about
the SMBH. The two-body relaxation timescale for a
single-mass system is:

trelax = 0.34
σ3

G2ρ〈M∗〉 ln Λrlx
, (10)

where ln Λrlx is the Coulomb logarithm and 〈M∗〉 is the
average mass of the surrounding objects, here assumed
to be 1M⊙ (Spitzer 1987; Binney & Tremaine 2008,

Eq. (7.106)). This equation represents the approximate
timescale for a BH on a semi-circular orbit to change
its orbital energy and angular momentum by order of
themselves. The BH experiences diffusion in its angular
momentum and energy as a function of time (depending
on the eccentricity of the orbit, this process can be more
efficient Fragione & Sari 2018; Sari & Fragione 2019). In
Figure 1, we plot the relaxation timescale in gold for a
range of α. We note that the Bahcall & Wolf (1976) profile,
α = 7/4, corresponds to zero net flux and therefore
does not preferentially migrate objects inward.

Additionally, because they are more massive on
average than the surrounding objects, BHs are expected
to segregate inwards in the GN (e.g., Shapiro
& Marchant 1978; Cohn & Kulsrud 1978; Morris 1993;
Miralda-Escudé & Gould 2000; Baumgardt et al. 2004).




Figure 3. On the right, we plot final masses of 500 BHs using different values of α in the density profile, shallow (α = 1) to
cuspy (α = 2). For the latter case, the purple line shows the analytical result from Eq. 8, taking minitial to be the average mass
of the population. Faded stars indicate BHs that merged with the SMBH through GWs. On the left, we plot the masses and
merger times of these BHs.

They sink toward the SMBH on the mass segregation

timescale, tseg ≈ 〈M∗〉/mBH × trelax (e.g., Spitzer 1987;
Fregeau et al. 2002; Merritt 2006), which is typically an
order of magnitude smaller than the relaxation timescale
plotted in Figure 1.

We incorporate relaxation processes by introducing a
small change in the BH’s energy and angular momentum
each time it orbits the SMBH. We apply a small

instantaneous velocity kick to the BH, denoted as ∆v.

We draw ∆v from a Guassian distribution with average

of zero and a standard deviation of ∆vrlx/√3, where

∆vrlx = v•√
P•/trlx (see Bradnick et al. 2017, for an
approach to changes in the angular momentum). The
new orbital parameters can be calculated following Lu
& Naoz (2019), and see Naoz et al. in prep for full set
of equations.

We account for the effects of relaxation processes,
including mass-segregation, using a multi-faceted approach.
We begin by migrating each BH towards the
center over its mass-segregation timescale, shifting it incrementally
inward such that its orbital energy changes

by order of itself within the segregation timescale.

As the BHs segregate down the potential well, their
abundance with respect to stars increases, until at some
turnover radius, BHs become the dominant source of
scattering for both black holes and stars. Within this radius,
BH self-interaction dominates over two-body scatterings
with the now rarer main-sequence stars. The
BHs will then settle onto a Bahcall-Wolf profile, while
the stars may follow a shallower profile, with approximately
n⋆ ∝ r−1.5, inwards of the transition radius
(Linial & Sari in prep.).

Therefore, after the initial mass segregation, we allow

the BHs to begin diffusing over a relaxation timescale,

their orbital parameters changing slowly through a random
process. In this random process, some of the BHs
may migrate closer to the SMBH. We terminate mass
growth when the BH enters the inner 200 au of the GN,
within which the density of stars is uncertain. This cutoff
is based on the 120 au pericenter of S0-2, the closest
known star to the SMBH (e.g., Ghez et al. 2005).

Another physical process that causes inward migration
is dynamical friction. A cursory derivation based
on the dynamical friction equations described in Binney
& Tremaine (2008) reveals the process to have a similar
timescale to mass segregation. If a BH diffuses to
a distance greater than 2 pc from the SMBH, exiting
the sphere of influence, we have it sink inwards, back
towards the center, over a dynamical friction timescale.

After one dynamical friction timescale has passed, we
restart diffusion.

We note that our prescription ignores self-interactions
between the BHs. As mentioned above, as the BHs sink
towards the SMBH, their concentration in the inner region
of the GN increases, allowing them to dominate the

scattering. We reserve the inclusion of these interactions

for future study.

2.9. Effect of Relaxation Processes

As depicted in Figure 4, two-body relaxation processes
result in more EMRIs and IMRIs events. These processes
allow BHs that begin further from the SMBH
to migrate inwards and grow more efficiently in mass.

Figure 4. Similar to Figure 3, we plot the initial masses versus initial distance (grey) and final mass versus final distance (red)
for 500 BHs. This simulation includes relaxation processes, including mass segregation, diffusion, and dynamical friction. We
assume α = 1.75 for the GN density profile. Faded stars represent BHs that merged with the SMBH. As a result of inward
migration, BHs merge more quickly with the SMBH, before they can become as massive as those in Figure 3. Additionally, more
BHs become EMRIs and IMRIs. Additionally, in the third panel, we show a histogram of the simulated IMBH masses for two
different values of α, 1.5 (orange, solid), α, 1.75 (red, dashed), and 2 (purple, dash-dotted), accounting for relaxation processes.
The dashed, faded lines represent the corresponding initial histograms. We assume α = 1.75 for the GN density profile. Faded
stars represent BHs that merged with the SMBH.

However, it also impedes the growth of BHs that are
initially closer to the SMBH by allowing them to diffuse
out of the inner region where collisions are efficient.

As can be seen in Figure 4, the net result is that more
BHs grow, but the maximum mass is lower compared
to the scenario that ignores two-body relaxation. The
histogram in Figure 4 presents the final BH mass distributions
for different power law indices α. As expected,

the two-body relaxation suppresses the α dependence
highlighted in Figure 3. In fact, using a KS test, we
find that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the two
distributions were drawn from the same sample for the
α = 1.75 and α = 2 results. Interestingly, a BH mass
IMF with an average of 10 M⊙ leads to a final distribution
with an average of ∼ 200 M⊙ and a median of
∼ 45 M⊙, which lies within the mass gap.

3. DISCUSSION AND PREDICTIONS

We explore the feasibility of forming IMBHs in a
GN through successive collisions between a stellar-mass

BH and main-sequence stars. Taking both a statistical
and analytic approach, we show that this channel
can produce IMBHs efficiently with masses as high as
103−4 M⊙ and may result in many IMBH-SMBH mergers
(intermediate-mass ratio inspiral, IMRIs) and EMRIs.


As the stellar mass BH collides with a star, the BH
will grow in mass. The increase may equal star’s entire
mass if the relative velocity is smaller than the escape
velocity from the BH at 1 R⊙. However, near the
SMBH, the velocity dispersion may be larger than the
escape velocity from the BH at the star’s radius. In this
limit, the BH accretes a “tunnel” of material through
the star, estimated using Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion.
In our statistical analysis, we account for Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion and find that BHs outside of
10−2 pc from the SMBH can accrete the entire star (see
Figure 2).

The efficiency of collisions, and therefore IMBH,
EMRI, and IMRI formation as well, are sensitive to
the underlying stellar density. As shown in Figure 3, a
steeper density profile results in larger IMBHs. This behavior
can be understood from the collision timescale’s
dependence on the stellar density profile. A steeper profile
yields shorter collision timescales near the SMBH.

However, the inclusion of relaxation processes in the
simulations dampens the influence of the stellar density
profile by allowing BHs to diffuse into regions of more
or less efficient growth. As a result, more BHs grow in

mass, but their maximum mass is smaller (∼ 104 M⊙).
Additionally, the final masses have no apparent dependence
on distance from the SMBH (see Figure 4).

Mass growth through BH-main-sequence star collisions
may act in concert with other IMBH formation
channels, such as compact object binary mergers (e.g.,
Hoang et al. 2018; Stephan et al. 2019; Fragione et al.
2021; Wang et al. 2021). While in some cases collisions
can unbind a binary (e.g., Sigurdsson & Phinney
1993; Fregeau et al. 2004), BH binaries can be tightly
bound enough to withstand the collisions. Wide binaries
may also become unbound due to interactions with
the neighboring stars and compact objects (e.g., Binney
& Tremaine 1987; Rose et al. 2020, see latter study for
the timescale for an arbitrary eccentricity). However,
as highlighted in previous studies, a substantial fraction
of these binaries may merge due to the Eccentric
Kozai Lidov mechanism, leaving behind a single star or
a single compact object (e.g., Stephan et al. 2016, 2019;
Hoang et al. 2018). Additionally, to be susceptible to
evaporation, BH binaries must have a wider configuration.
Otherwise, they will be more tightly bound that
the average kinetic energy of the surrounding objects,
and will only harden through weak gravitational interactions
with neighboring stars (see for example Figure
6 in Rose et al. 2020).

Not included in this study, collisions between the BH
and other compact objects will increase the BH growth
rate. BH-BH mergers (e.g., O’Leary et al. 2009; Fragione
et al. 2021) and even neutron star BH mergers
(e.g., Hoang et al. 2020) become more likely as the BHs
increase in mass through stellar collisions. As a result,
the BH-BH collision timescale, discussed in Section 2.2,
will become relevant to our simulations, allowing the
BHs to grow through this channel in addition to stellar
collisions. Additionally, this compact object mergers
result in GW recoil, which may have a large impact on
the dynamics (e.g., Baibhav et al. 2020; Fragione et al.
2021)

The BH’s mass growth increases GW emission, which
dissipates energy from the orbit. Along with relaxation
processes, GW emission causes BHs to sink towards the
SMBH and eventually undergo a merger. As a result,
the GN environment is conducive to the formation of
EMRIs and IMRIs. The GW emission from EMRIs and
IMRIs is expected to be at mHz frequencies, making
them promising candidates for LISA to observe. While
the exact rate calculation is beyond the scope of this
study, the mechanism outlined here seems very promising.

Our results also suggest that IMBHs are likely to exists
in many galactic nuclei, as well as within our own
galactic center. This implication seems to be consistent
with recent observational and theoretical studies
(e.g., Hansen & Milosavljević 2003; Maillard et al. 2004;
Gürkan & Rasio 2005; Gualandris & Merritt 2009; Chen
& Liu 2013; Generozov & Madigan 2020; Fragione et al.
2020a; Zheng et al. 2020; Naoz et al. 2020; GRAVITY
Collaboration et al. 2020).

Lastly, the collisions between stellar mass BHs and
stars may contribute to the x-ray emission from our
galactic centre (e.g., Muno et al. 2005, 2009; Hailey et al.

2018; Zhu et al. 2018; Cheng et al. 2018)5. These interactions,
in particular grazing collisions, may also result
in tidal disruption events (e.g., Perets et al. 2016; Samsing
et al. 2019; Kremer et al. 2021). Thus, the process
outlined here may produce electromagnetic signatures
in addition to GW mergers.
