Abstract


As is common with the collection of astronomical data, signals are frequently dominated
by noise. However, when performing FTs of light curves, re-binning data can improve the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at lower frequencies. Using data collected from the Kepler space telescope,
we sequentially re-binned data three times to investigate the SNR improvement of lower frequency
(< 17 µHz) variability in white dwarf KIC 8626021. We found that the SNR at approximately 5.8
µHz greatly improved through this process, and we postulate that this frequency is linked to the
rotation of KIC 8626021.

Introduction

First detected in 1862, white dwarfs long posed a mystery for early observers. When the

companion to Sirius was detected, apparent contradictions concerning the mass, luminosities, and
densities baffled astronomers. Lacking full understanding of atomic structures and the energy
states of electrons, these early researchers believed white dwarfs too dense to exist. However, new
discoveries at the turn of the 20th century explained the existence of these stars, and between the
world wars white dwarfs were increasingly studied and modeled (Holberg, 2009).

As stars age, those that lack the mass to become neutron stars and black holes become
white dwarf stars, representing 98% of the stars in our galaxy (Winget & Kepler, 2008). They are
composed of a core of carbon and oxygen ions that slowly cools over billions of years, and the
light emanating from these stars is a result of thermal energy. White dwarf stars are no longer
supported against the force of gravity by fusion, so the stars collapse into an electron-degenerate
state where the electrons in the carbon and oxygen atoms occupy the lowest energy levels. As two
electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, Pauli repulsion keeps white dwarfs from
collapsing entirely.

For many years, accurate detection of light variability in white dwarfs was difficult due to
a lack of adequate instruments. However, the launch of the Kepler space telescope in 2009 made
capturing the light of distant stars much more efficient and effective (Basri et al., 2010). Kepler
was initially developed with the intention of surveying our region of the Milky Way galaxy in
order to find potentially habitable planets. The purpose of the mission was to identify key traits for
such planets by determining the number of planets in habitable zones, the sizes and shapes of orbits,
and the characteristics of the stars being orbited. Over the lifespan of its first mission, Kepler
observed approximately 1.5 x 105 stars (Johnson, 2018), affording scientists excellent
opportunities to research stellar variability. Due to the loss of a second reaction wheel in 2013,
NASA developed the K2 mission, a way to prolong Kepler’s assistance to astronomy and
astrophysics.

Utilizing Kepler’s ability to maintain three-dimensional control, NASA proceeded to use
the telescope to collect photometry data of certain sections of our galaxy, although the number of
targets was significantly reduced. In addition, the K2 mission was designed to be community-oriented,
with the scientific community having an influence on the fields observed and serving as
the analysts of the vast amounts of data being received (Howell et al., 2014). Although Kepler was
deactivated in 2018, the data used in this paper came from observations during 2010 and 2012 of
white dwarf KIC 8626021 and was obtained from the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations
Center (KASOC).

The DBV white dwarf KIC 8626021 has an atmosphere rich in helium. Building upon
previous studies, this research investigated novel techniques of analyzing variability in white
dwarfs. The dwarf KIC 8626021 was chosen due to the large amount of preexisting research on
the star, allowing for the validation of results using our methods. KIC 8626021 has an effective
temperature of 29,700 K, log g = 7.890, and mass of 0.56 M☉ (Córsico, 2020). Other research
has found that this white dwarf is the DBV with the highest known temperature, and its helium
layer is the thinnest (Bischoff-Kim et al., 2015). Despite the long-cadence light curve being too
noisy to draw many conclusions, other FTs of short-cadence data have been performed to find
variability in the dwarf. Analyses at high frequencies of KIC 8626021 yielded pulsations with
frequencies of 4309.89 µHz, 5073.26 µHz, 3681.87 µHz, 3294.22 µHz and 2658.85 µHz
(Østensen et al., 2011). These findings confirm the classification of the white dwarf as a V777
Herculis, although our research focuses on low frequencies using long-cadence data.





Methods

All data were downloaded from the KASOC database, and the long-cadence (data

sampled approximately every thirty minutes) measurements of Corrected Flux (ppm) were
analyzed. All computations were made in Wolfram Mathematica and Microsoft Excel, and FTs
were performed in Mathematica. The re-binning process consisted of summing adjacent light
curve data points in each quarter, therefore doubling the sampling interval from 0.5 hour to one
hour, and then repeating this process on the data sample for a total of three times. In addition, a
significant detection was defined as being 3𝝈 above the mean of the relative flux, and 0 on the
graphs below represents this 3𝝈 cutoff. (Koch, D. G., 2010), (Wolfram Research, Inc., 2021). To
find the SNR, we converted to decibels. Using these SNRs, we were able to easily identify
improvement in signal strength.



Results


Figure 1 presents the lightcurves constructed for quarters seven (Q7) and thirteen (Q13),
with corrected flux magnitude (ppm) plotted versus time (Julian days). Figure 2 presents the FTs
of the first iteration and three successive re-bins for Q7, while Figure 3 presents the FTs of the
same for Q13.
 Tables 1 and 2 both show the hypothesized frequency corresponding to the rotation of
KIC 8626021 that is found in the FTs of the first iteration and subsequent re-bins for Q7 and
Q13. Tables 3 and 4 show all data values < 17 µHz found in the first iterations and re-bins of Q7
and Q13.


FIG. 1: Pictured top is the light curve constructed for Q7, below is the light curve for Q13. Q7
lasted from September 24 – December 13, 2010, and Q13 was from March 29 – June 23, 2012.
Both graphs were constructed by plotting corrected flux magnitude (flux corrected for
instrumental artifacts) versus time in Excel, and gaps in the data were filled in by interpolating
between points. Q7 had forty-three interpolated points, and Q13 had sixty-six.





FIG. 2: The graphs show the initial FTs of Q7, and then the FTs of the three successive re-bins of
the light curve data. The significant frequencies of 5.886 µHz and 5.889 µHz are circled. The
disappearance of the frequency in the last FT is most likely a byproduct of the method, and the
spurious frequency of 5.464 µHz in the last FT most probably represents an artifact of the re-binning
process.










FIG. 3: The graphs show the initial FT of Q13, and then the FTs of the three successive re-bins
of the light curve data. The significant frequencies of 5.784 µHz and 5.787 µHz are circled. In
addition, in the third re-bin, the frequencies 11.641 µHz and 16.823 µHz rise above 3𝝈 and are
nearly perfect integer multiples of 5.787 µHz. These harmonics are potentially indications of a
starspot (Santos et al., 2017).

Conclusions


As our research used the long-cadence data from Kepler, much of the high-frequency
variability due to gravitational wave pulsations is lost. However, this presents an opportunity to
verify our results with the work of research groups that analyzed short-cadence data.With the
data analyzed, the lower frequencies between 5-6 µHz emerged. After finding the average of the
periods and accounting for a 1𝝈 margin of error, our research hypothesizes that the rotation
period of KIC 8626021 is 1.99 ± 0.02 days. Other short-cadence research has found the rotation
period to be 1.8 ± 0.4 days, by analyzing the structures of independent modes (Bischoff-Kim et
al., 2015). Other calculated periods of rotation have been ≈ 1.7 days (Østensen et al., 2011), and
these periods indicate that the more precise significant period identified through our re-binning
relates to the rotation of the white dwarf.

Through the re-binning process, the SNR clearly improves for both quarters, and for Q7 it
improves by approximately 1.3 dB, except for the last data re-bin. In the last re-bin, the previous
significant frequency disappears, which becomes increasingly likely after successive re-binning
processes. The frequency 5.464 µHz rises as another significant frequency; however, we believe
that this new frequency is simply an artifact of the re-binning process. In Q13, we saw SNR
improvement ranging from 1.1 dB to 1.3 dB.

Through the re-binning process, more lines, or significant frequencies, appeared above
the 3𝝈 cutoff, particularly at lower frequencies. These findings suggest that as an alternative to
short-cadence analysis, the re-binning process of long-cadence data can be used to identify
significant lower frequencies in white dwarfs. The methods we used are also simple and
replicable, which allows even those with less experience to quickly analyze the large amounts of
data being collected by orbiting telescopes, such as the currently active TESS (Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite) telescope.

The presence of possible harmonics in the third re-bin of Q13 also indicates the possible
presence of a previously unseen starspot in KIC 8626021 caused by magnetic activity. These
spots are darker, cooler, and modulate stellar light curves, and with confirmation of its existence,
the harmonic frequencies can be used to calculate the spot’s rotation rate, size, latitude, and
contrast (Santos et al., 2017). Using the process of re-binning, a starspot signal, previously
dominated by noise, may have been discovered.
