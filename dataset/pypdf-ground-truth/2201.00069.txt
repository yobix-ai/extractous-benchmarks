ABSTRACT
We report on a search for persistent radio emission from the one-off Fast Radio Burst (FRB)
20190714A, as well as from two repeating FRBs, 20190711A and 20171019A, using the
MeerKAT radio telescope. For FRB 20171019Awe also conducted simultaneous observations
with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in very high energy gamma rays and
searched for signals in the ultraviolet, optical, and X-ray bands. For this FRB, we obtain a UV
flux upper limit of 1.39×10−16 erg cm−2 s−1Å−1, X-ray limit of ∼ 6.6×10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 and
a limit on the very-high-energy gamma-ray fluxΦ(𝐸 > 120GeV) < 1.7× 10−12 erg cm−2 s−1.
We obtain a radio upper limit of∼15`Jy beam−1 for persistent emission at the locations of both
FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A, but detect diffuse radio emission with a peak brightness
of ∼53`Jy beam−1 associated with FRB 20190714A at 𝑧 = 0.2365. This represents the first
detection of the radio continuum emission potentially associated with the host (galaxy) of FRB
20190714A, and is only the third known FRB to have such an association. Given the possible
association of a faint persistent source, FRB 20190714A may potentially be a repeating FRB
whose age lies between that of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916A. A parallel search for
repeat bursts from these FRBs revealed no new detections down to a fluence of 0.08 Jyms for
a 1 ms duration burst.
Key words: fast radio bursts – radio continuum: galaxies – radiationmechanisms: non-thermal

1 INTRODUCTION

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous transients that last for microseconds
to milliseconds and occur at extragalactic to cosmological
distances (e.g. Lorimer et al. 2007; Thornton et al. 2013;
Macquart et al. 2020). The estimated high radio luminosities and
associated brightness temperatures required to produce these short-timescale
energetic events at such distances are what makes them
intriguing (Petroff et al. 2021; Caleb&Keane 2021). They have been
observed to emit from ∼ 110MHz − 8GHz, though not yet across
a wide and continuous frequency band due to the variable band-limited
spectra of the single pulses. Over 600 FRBs have been discovered1
of which ∼ 20 have been seen to repeat, and it is presently
uncertain whether they all do (Caleb et al. 2019; James et al. 2020).
The extraordinary observed characteristics of the repeating and non-repeating
FRBs have led to various progenitor models with the bulk
of them favouring neutron stars. Progenitor theories include binary
neutron star mergers and collisions (Totani 2013; Yamasaki et al.
2018), giant pulses from extragalactic pulsars (Cordes & Wasserman
2016; Popov & Pshirkov 2016), hyperflares and giant flares
from magnetars (Popov & Postnov 2013; Popov et al. 2018), binary
white dwarf mergers (Kashiyama et al. 2013), neutron star “combing"
(Zhang 2018) and interactions of neutron stars with active
galactic nuclei (Vieyro et al. 2017) (see Platts et al. (2019) for a list
of potential progenitors). Some of these models predict radio after-glows
accompanying an FRB with timescales of days to years. Liu
et al. (2016) propose that the merger of a Kerr-Newman black hole
binary is one of the plausible central engines for FRBs and their
afterglows. Dai et al. (2017), however, suggest that the persistent
emission is due to an ultra-relativistic pulsar wind nebula sweeping
up its ambient mediumwith FRBs repeatedly produced through one
of several potential mechanisms. In the magnetar model byMargalit
et al. (2019), FRBs produced by binary neutron star mergers and
accretion induced collapse are expected to be accompanied by persistent
radio continuum emission on timescales of months to years.

The persistent emission is powered by the nebula of relativistic electrons
and magnetic fields inflated by the magnetar flares (Margalit
et al. 2019). The existence of persistent emission associated with
FRBs could provide vital clues to their origin. Moreover, potential
candidates and models for FRB progenitors predict counterparts
in the X-ray an TeV bands. For example, a model by Lyubarsky
(2014) predicts millisecond outbursts of TeV emission accompanying
FRBs from magnetars. In 2020, FRB20200428 was discovered
for the first time from a galactic magnetar, SGR1935+2154. Furthermore,
an X-ray counterpart to this FRB was deteced for the first
time by several instruments (Tavani et al. 2021; Ridnaia et al. 2021;
Mereghetti et al. 2020; Insight-HXMT 2020).

Of the 19 FRBs that have been associated with host galaxies2,
only the sub-arcsecond localisation of the repeating FRB
20121102A to a host galaxy at a redshift of 𝑧 = 0.19273 ± 0.0008
(Tendulkar et al. 2017; Bassa et al. 2017) showed that it is physically
associated with a compact (≤ 0.7 pc), persistent radio source
of luminosity a𝐿a ∼ 1039 erg s−1 at a few GHz (Marcote et al.
2017). This source is detectable from 300MHz – 26GHz (Resmi
et al. 2020; Chatterjee et al. 2017) and is seen to exhibit ∼ 10% variability
on day timescales. In contrast, a similar sub-milliarcsecond
localisation of another repeating FRB20180916B to a nearby massive
spiral galaxy at 𝑧 = 0.0337 ± 0.0002 (Marcote et al. 2020)
showed no associated persistent radio emission. This places a strong
upper limit on the persistent source luminosity of a𝐿a . 7.6×1035
erg s−1 at 1.6GHz, which is three orders of magnitude lower than
that of FRB 20121102A. Recently, the CHIME/FRB collaboration
announced heightened activity in the repeating FRB 20201124A
(Chime/FRB Collaboration 2021), which was localised to a host
galaxy at a redshift of 𝑧 = 0.0979 ± 0.0001 (Fong et al. 2021).
Persistent radio emission was detected by the upgraded Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (uGMRT) (Wharton et al. 2021) and the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) (Ricci et al. 2021) on
angular scales of a few arcseconds, but resolved out to scales of
∼ 0.1 arcseconds with the European VLBI Network (Marcote et al.
2021).

MeerKAT, e-MERLIN, Swift and H.E.S.S., observations of three localised FRBs 3

buffered raw voltage data at 1.4GHz (Bannister et al. 2019;
Prochaska et al. 2019; Macquart et al. 2020) by the Australian
SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope did not yield persistent radio
continuum emission from the host galaxies (Bhandari et al. 2020).
Australian TelescopeCompact Array (ATCA) observations of FRBs
20180924B, 20181112A, 20190102C and 20190608B were conducted
at a centre frequency of 6.5GHz. No persistent emission as
luminous as the one associated with FRB 20121102A was detected
for the ASKAP FRBs (Bhandari et al. 2020). While the true age of
FRB 121102A is unknown, models based on polarization studies
predict the age to be ∼ 6 − 17 years (Hilmarsson et al. 2021). It is
possible that younger, more active FRBs like FRB 20121102A are
associated with persistent radio emission while the emission might
have faded over time for the older ones. The possibility of repeating
FRBs not being so uncommon after all (Ravi 2019) along with the
increasing arcsecond localisations suggests that we are entering an
era where we can begin to look for evidence of multiple classes by
studying FRB host galaxies and multi-wavelength counterparts.

In this paper, we report on the search for persistent radio emission
in the host galaxies of one apparent one-off source (FRB
20190714A) and two repeating sources (FRBs 20171019A and
20190711A) (Kumar et al. 2019, 2021) using MeerKAT. In case
of the latter, we also conducted simultaneous observations with the
High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in very high energy
gamma rays. In addition, we searched for signals in the ultraviolet,
optical, and X-ray bands. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2,
we discuss our observations and data reduction; in Section 3,
we discuss the single radio continuum detection and derived multiwavelength
upper limits. Our discussion and conclusions follow in
Section 4 and 5.

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION

2.1 MeerKAT observations

The MeerKAT 64-parabolic-dish array (Jonas & MeerKAT Team
2016; Mauch et al. 2020) is located in the Northern Karoo desert
near Carnarvon, South Africa. Each “offset Gregorian" parabolic
dish antenna has an effective diameter of 13.5m. The inner core of
the array contains 48 of the 64 dishes in a 1 km radius, while the
remaining 16 dishes are spread outward up to 8 km. The shortest and
longest baselines of the MeerKAT array are 29m and 8 km, respectively,
providing angular scales of 5′′ to 27′ at the central frequency,
of the L-band receiver used here, of 1283MHz. Multi-epoch observations
of the FRB fields were conducted with the MeerKAT
array (Project ID: SCI-20190418-VC-01) at L-band (856MHz to
1712MHz). Details of the MeerKAT observations are presented
in Table 1. Only Stokes I (total intensity) of the MeerKAT observations
are considered in this paper. The data correlation was
done with the SKARAB correlator (Hickish et al. 2016) in 4k mode
which gives 4096 channels across the 856MHz bandwidth resulting
in a frequency resolution of ∼209 kHz. The data were reduced using
the semi-automated MeerKAT data analysis pipelines - 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡3
(Heywood 2020).

2.1.1 Imaging analysis

The 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡 pipeline employs a collection of publicly available radio
interferometry data reduction software. The final data prod

3 https://ascl.net/code/v/2627

ucts, including reduced and calibrated visibility data (including
self-calibration), continuum (including sub-band) images as well
as diagnostic plots, are provided by the pipeline. The customary
configuration of the 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡 pipeline incorporates flagging, cross-calibration
and self-calibration processes. In the flagging process,
the low-gain bandpass edges (856MHz to 880MHz and 1658MHz
to 1800MHz) are flagged on all baselines, along with the location of
the Galactic neutral hydrogen line at 1419.8MHz to 1421.3MHz.
Several other radio frequency interference (RFI) prone regions of
the spectrum are then flagged on baselines shorter than 600 m.
Then, other possible RFI affected data are flagged out using the
CASA routines rflag and tfcrop for the calibrators, and using the
tricolour package for the target fields.

The cross-calibration steps using 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡 were standard, including
setting the flux scale and deriving corrections for residual delay
calibration, bandpass and time-varying gain. The 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡 pipeline
uses the customary tasks from the CASA (McMullin et al. 2007)
suite for cross-calibration. After applying all the corrections to the
target field, we channel-averaged the dataset by a factor of five channels
before splitting out the science target. This is consistent with our
science goals, since the relic sourceswe target are in the central parts
of our fields, reducing the effect of smearing through the channel
averaging. To deconvolve and image the target data, the WSClean
imager (Offringa et al. 2014) was used, with the multiscale and
wideband deconvolution algorithms enabled to better allow imaging
of the diffuse emission present in the our fields. Deconvolution
was performed in ten sub-band images of each 82MHz wide-band.
WSClean generates the multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) map, in
joined-channel deconvolution mode, with a central frequency of
1283MHz. In other words, the MFS map is a full bandwidth map.
In WSClean, each of the sub-bands is deconvolved separately with
an initially high mask of 20𝜎rms (using the auto masking function
provided by WSClean), to generate an artefact-free model of the
target field for the self-calibration process. This masking threshold
was iteratively reduced to a value of 3𝜎rms in the final iteration
of imaging. The 𝑜𝑥𝑘𝑎𝑡 pipeline uses the customary tasks from the
Cubical software (Kenyon et al. 2018) for self-calibration.

2.1.2 Single pulse searches

In addition to obtaining correlated data, the output data stream of
the F-engine are captured, delay corrected, phased and channelised
before being sent over the central beamforming network to the beam-formingUser
Supplied Equipment (FBFUSE) thatwas designed and
developed at theMax Planck Institute for RadioAstronomy in Bonn.
For this project, FBFUSE combined the data into 764 total-intensity
tied-array beams which were used to populate the primary beam of
∼ 1 deg2 of the array. The data are then captured at 306.24 μs time
resolution by the Transient User Supplied Equipment (TUSE), a
real-time transient detection backend instrument developed by the
MeerTRAP4 team at the University of Manchester. More details on
TUSE will be presented in an upcoming paper (Stappers et al. in
prep). The GPU-based single pulse search pipeline AstroAccelerate5
(Dimoudi & Armour 2015; Adámek & Armour 2016; Adámek
et al. 2017; Dimoudi et al. 2018; Adámek&Armour 2019) was used
to search for bursts in real-time after incoherently de-dispersing the
data in the DM range 0–5118.4 pc cm−3 (see Caleb et al. 2020, for
more details).

2.2 e-MERLIN Observations

To constrain the position of the persistent continuum emission
associated with FRB20190714A, we conducted L-band (centre
frequency of 1.51GHz) observations of the target with the enhanced
Multi-Element Remote-Linked Interferometer Network, e-MERLIN
array in the United Kingdom (project code: CY10003)
on 13 January, 2021 (see Section 3.1.2). Six antennas were used
including the 75-m Lovell telescope and the target pointing centre
was R.A. = 12ℎ15𝑚55𝑠 .12, Dec. = −13◦01′15.′′7. 1407+2827
was used as the bandpass calibrator, 1331+3030 as the flux calibrator
and 1216−1033 as the phase calibrator. The angular separation
between the target and the phase calibrator is 2.47◦. The
data reduction was done following standard e-MERLIN calibration
procedures6 with additional flagging of bad visibilities followed
by imaging. We found two confusing sources in the field,
at R.A. = 12ℎ15𝑚44𝑠 .669, Dec. = −12◦57′59.′′56 and R.A. =
12ℎ15𝑚37𝑠 .216, Dec. = −13◦09′33.′′44 at 4.1′ and 9.4′ from the
pointing centre, respectively. They had apparent flux densities of 4
and 1.3mJy without primary beam correction. We used these for
self-calibration of the field and then subtracted them before final
imaging. The final image synthesized beam is 0.′′65 × 0.′′15, position
angle 15◦ elongated in the Declination direction due to the low
target elevation from the UK.

2.3 The Swift satellite: UVOT and XRT observations

NeilGehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) is amulti-wavelengthNASA
space mission operating in soft-X-rays and optical/UV. Here we
use data from the X-ray Telescope (XRT) (Burrows et al. 2005)
which operates in the soft X-ray domain of 0.3 − 10 keV as well as
data taken by the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT) (Roming et al.
2005) operating in the UV to optical domain (170 − 600 nm).
During the FRB 20171019A multi-wavelength (MWL) observing
campaign, two 2 ks target-of-opportunity (ToO) observations were
performed with Swift from 2019-09-28 18:37:02 to 2019-09-28
21:52:54 and 2019-10-18 18:03:00 to 2019-10-18 20:03:00 on the
FRB 20171019A localisation region. Simultaneously with Swift-XRT,
five UVOT images were taken with the UVM2 filter (central
wavelengh = 2246Å) over the 2 epochs with a total exposure of 4 ks.
The images are aspect-corrected and summed with the uvotimsum
tool (HEASOFT 6.26). Observations were performed with Swift-XRT
in the standard Photon Counting observing mode (PC). The
XRT PC data are processed with xrtpipeline (HEASOFT 6.26).
A summed image is extracted with xselect.

2.4 Very-high energy gamma-ray observations with H.E.S.S.

Observations of FRB 20171019A were also obtained in the very-high
energy gamma-ray domain with the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric
Cherenkov telescope array, sensitive in the range between a
few tens of GeVs and 100 TeV. H.E.S.S. is located on the Khomas
Highland plateau of Namibia (23◦16′18′′ South, 16◦30′00′′ East),
at an elevation of ∼1800 m above sea level. Observations took place
contemporaneously to the first epoch of MeerKAT observations of
FRB 20171019A described above. The data set was obtained with
the H.E.S.S. phase II array, including the upgraded 12m-diameter
CT1-4 telescopes (Ashton et al. 2020) and the large 28m-diameter

6 https://github.com/e-merlin/eMERLIN_CASA_pipeline

CT5 telescope (Bolmont et al. 2014). A standard data quality selection
was applied to the data (Aharonian et al. 2006). The events have
then been selected and their direction and energy reconstructed using
a log-likelihood minimization comparing the recorded shower
images of all triggered telescopes (requiring at least two telescopes
to see the same gamma-ray event) to a semi-analytical model of air
showers (de Naurois & Rolland 2009).

We define a circular region-of-interest centered on the position
of FRB 20171019A with a radius of 0.12◦, optimal for a point-like
source of emission as expected from FRB20171019A. The background
level in this ON region was determined using the standard
“ring background” technique (Berge et al. 2007) based on a radially
symmetric ring around the source position. This technique allows us
to derive the background level from the same field of view and assures
that the gamma-ray signal and background are estimated with
the same acceptance and under the same observation conditions.

3 RESULTS

3.1 MeerKAT

The theoretical thermal noise of the MeerKAT can be calculated as

𝑆rms =
1[𝑐SEFD√︃𝑛pol × 𝑁 (𝑁 − 1) × Δa × 𝑡int. (1)

The system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of MeerKAT at the
1.28GHz is 443 Jy and [𝑐 is the correlator efficiency. We used 𝑛pol
= 2 polarisation products (XX and YY), N = 64 telescopes, Δa =
856MHz bandwidth and 𝑡int = 21600 sec observing time for one
epoch. This gives the theoretical rms of∼ 2 `Jy beam−1. The typical
image rms obtained from our residual images is ∼ 5 `Jy beam−1,
which is 2.5 times the expected theoretical rms. The widebandMFS
image does not allow primary beam correction procedure as this can
only be done on the sub-band images with limited rms for detection
of the sources. However, our sources are the phase centres of our
fields and thus unaffected by the effect of the primary beam.

Due to the lack of MeerKAT primary beam correction, we
did not compare the flux densities of the discrete sources with
their NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory) VLA (Very
Large Array) Sky Survey (NVSS) counterparts. However, Chibueze
et al. (2021, submitted) confirmed that the overall flux densities
obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS are in good agreement with
each other within errors of ∼ 5%. We compared the astrometry of
the discrete radio sources obtained with MeerKAT and NVSS in
Figure 1. The position uncertainty of the MeerKAT ranges from
0.′′2 (close to the centre of the primary beam) to a few arcseconds
towards the edge of the primary beam. The scatter observed in
Figure 1 is mostly due to the probability of the centroids of emission
in the ∼45′′ NVSS resolution being different from the centroids at
MeerKAT’s resolution and partly due to higher position uncertainty
of the fainter sources. Therefore, we conclude that our MeerKAT
data are well calibrated and the flux density and astrometry are as
accurate as the errors indicate.

3.1.1 Looking for persistent continuum emission associated with
the FRB fields

Considering the results of the astrometric comparison with NVSS
(see Figure 1), we considered potential associations of continuum
sources in the MeerKAT observations with the FRB loca

tion to sources within 5′′. Using this spatial coincidence criterion,
we identified a persistent 1283MHz continuum source near FRB
20190714A, detected in both the 14 September 2019 and the 28
September 2019 epoch. The peak of the MeerKAT radio emission
is offset by ∼ 2′′.1 from the peak of the 𝑖-band magnitude of the optical
galaxy identified in the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid
Response System (PanSTARRS, located at Haleakala Observatory)
image (shown as contours in Figures 2 and 3). The MeerKAT radio
source is offset by 1.′′68 from the localisation region of FRB
20190714 (cyan circle in Figures 2 and 3).

3.1.2 e-MERLIN detection of compact emission towards
FRB 20190714

Compact persistent emission was detected in the 1.51GHz e-MERLIN
image at R.A. = 12ℎ15𝑚55𝑠 .116, Dec. = −13◦01′14.′′48
at 86 `Jy beam−1 by e-MERLIN. The stochastic position uncertainty
is (0.04, 0.15) arcsec and the uncertainty (due to the separation
between phase-calibrator and target, and antenna position
uncertainty) is (0.013, 0.056) arcsec, giving a total astrometric
uncertainty of (0.04, 0.16) arcsec in R.A. and Dec., respectively.
The offset from the FRB position is negligible in R.A. and 1.2
arcsec in Dec. The rms in this region (of full primary beam sensitivity)
is 20 `Jy beam−1, making this a 4.3𝜎rms detection. It is
∼1.5𝜎rms higher than that of the MeerKAT detection. Although the
e-MERLIN flux scale nominal uncertainty is ∼5%, in these data it
is possibly higher due to the low declination of the phase-reference
source and to the strong RFI which were removed from the data
but may have affected the linearity of the receiver response. The
peak of the e-MERLIN radio emission is offset by ∼ 1.′′4 from the
peak of the PanSTARRS 𝑖-band emission in Figures 2 and 3. The
e-MERLIN radio source (shown by the cyan cross in Figures 2 and
3) is offset by 0.′′53 from the localised position of FRB 20190714.

We estimate the probability of a chance alignment of a background
persistent radio source and the host galaxy, following the
procedure of Eftekhari et al. (2018). Instead of using the FRB localisation
region, we use the area of the galaxy, which is taken as
2′′ × 2′′, twice the half light radius from Heintz et al. (2020). Given
the source has a flux density of ∼ 90`Jy we estimate the chance
alignment probability of 0.0008, which corresponds to 3.4𝜎. The
flux density threshold, assuming 3𝜎, for an unresolved radio source
is ∼ 15 `Jy. If instead we consider the probability of detecting any
radio source above our flux density threshold of 15`Jy, the probability
of a chance alignment is, therefore, approximately 0.8%, making
the statistical significance of our detection 2.6𝜎. This represents the
first detection of radio continuum emission associated with the host
(galaxy) of FRB 20190714A (see Figure 2 and 3).

3.1.3 MeerKAT non-detections

No continuum emission was detected near FRBs 20171019A and
20190711A. As each of the images of these sources has an rms
of ∼ 5 `Jy beam−1, the 3𝜎 intensity upper limit of any emission
associated with FRBs 20171019A and 20190711A will be ∼ 15 `Jy
beam−1 (see Table 1).

Candidate pulses above a signal-to-noise (S/N) of 10 from the
single pulse search withMeerTRAPwere visually inspected offline.
No new FRBs or repeat bursts from the known FRBs were detected
above a fluence threshold of 0.08 Jyms assuming a 1 ms duration
burst.

3.2 Swift

The UVOT summed image is presented in Figure 4. The UVOT
field of view corresponds roughly to the uncertainty7 of the localisation
region of FRB 20171019A (RA = 7.5′and DEC = 7′). Using
uvotdetect, we find 30 sources above the 5𝜎 level and within the
FRB 20171019A uncertainty region. Using a 3 arcsec maximum
separation, which is slightly larger than the UVOT PSF (Breeveld
et al. 2010), these sources are cross-matched with known catalogue
sources. We find that out of the 30 sources detected by UVOT, 28
are spatially coincident with stars catalogued in the SDSS catalogue
(DR12;Alam et al. 2015), and one source is coincident with a galaxy
(AGN broadline SDSS ID: 1237652599570890948 at 𝑧 ∼ 0.156).
This galaxy is also detected by theMeerKAT radio observations.We
use the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)8 to search for
known galaxies in the FRB 20171019A uncertainty regions.We find
multiple galaxies with unknown redshifts, therefore we cannot draw
conclusions on the host galaxy from our observations. Using a 50′′
circular ON region centred on the position of FRB 20171019A and
a 50′′ OFF region that does not contain any of the detected sources,
we run the uvotsource tool with a 5𝜎 background threshold and
obtain a flux upper limit of 1.4 × 10−16 erg cm−2 s−1Å−1 without
applying a Calactic extinction correction.

The XRT summed image is shown in Figure 5. At the edge
of the field-of-view, we detect a source spatially coincident with
the Wolf 1561 star. As we consider this source unrelated to the
FRB, we use the online Swift-XRT data products generator (Evans
et al. 2007) (Evans et al. 2009) to derive upper limits in the 0.3-10keV
range on the count rate of 0.001885 counts.s−1. Using
WebPIMMS9 (v4.11a) and assuming a weighted average 𝑁H = 5.12×
1020 cm−2 from the direction of the source estimated from the
NASA’s HEASARC 10 online tools (HI4PI Collaboration et al.
2016) and a power law model with a photon index = 2, this upper
limit translates to an energy flux of 6.6× 10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 (8.3×
10−14 erg cm−2 s−1 unabsorbed).

3.3 H.E.S.S.

No significant gamma-ray excess above the expected background
is detected from the direction of FRB 20171019A, with 52 gamma
candidate events from the source region and 524 background event.
A second analysis using an independent event calibration and reconstruction
(Parsons & Hinton 2014) confirms this result. A search for
variable emission on timescales ranging from milliseconds to several
minutes with tools provided in (Brun et al. 2020) does not reveal
any variability above 2.2𝜎. For the total data set of 1.8 h, 95% confidence
level (C. L.) upper limits on the photon flux are derived using
the method described by Rolke et al. (2005). The energy threshold
of the data is highly dependent on the zenith angle of the observations.
For these observations, the zenith angles range from 15 to 25
deg, which leads to an energy threshold for the stacked data set of
𝐸th = 120GeV. The upper limit on the Very High Energy (VHE)

4 DISCUSSION

Of the targeted FRB fields reported here, only FRB 20190714A
is observed to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio continuum
source. We obtain an upper limit of ∼ 15 `Jy beam−1 for
FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A, respectively, and a peak intensity
of ∼ 53 `Jy beam−1 for the emission coincident with FRB
20190714A. This source is detected at both epochs with similar
intensities within the measured rms of the images (see Tables 1 and
2 for details). The values in the Table 2 are derived by carrying
out 2D Gaussian fit using similar ellipses enclosing the detected
persistent emission. The average flux density is ∼ 3 times less than
that of the persistent source associated with FRBs 20121102A, one
of the most prolific repeaters, located at 𝑧 = 0.19273(8). Persistent
radio emission from FRB 20201124A was detected by the uGMRT
(Wharton et al. 2021) and the JVLA (Ricci et al. 2021) on angular
scales of a few arcseconds. However, it is resolved out at scales of
∼ 0.1 arcseconds with the European VLBI Network (Marcote et al.
2021) suggesting that it is not a compact source directly associated
with the FRB. In contrast, the other localised, prolific repeating
FRB 20180916A has no persistent radio counterpart.

In the image in Figure 3 one can see that the persistent radio
source lies at the edge of the optical extent of the host galaxy
as seen in PanSTARRS observations (Heintz et al. 2020). Our
derived 1283MHz peak position with MeerKAT places it just
1.′′68 away from the position of FRB 20190714A (𝛼𝐽2000, 𝛿𝐽2000
= 12ℎ15𝑚55𝑠 .12, -13◦01′15.′′70; Heintz et al. 2020). The positional
uncertainty on the FRB position is 0.′′283. Similarly, the peak
1.51GHz e-MERLIN position of the persistent radio source is separated
from the position of FRB 20190714A by 0.′′53. The persistent
source near FRB 20190714A has a flux broadly consistent with the
MeerKAT flux and is unresolved on the e-MERLIN baselines. The

large offset from the centre of the galaxymakes the persistent source
unlikely to be an AGN. So far this FRB has not been seen to repeat.
Higher resolution imaging will be required to be certain of a direct
association of the persistent source with the FRB. We did not have
sufficient sensitivity in the sub-band images, thus, we are unable to
derive the spectral index of the emission of the host galaxy.

Our e-MERLIN observations probe a different spatial
scale than the size of the persistent radio source associated
with FRB 20121102A. At the angular diameter distance of

FRB 20190714A (780 Mpc), an unresolved source with an angular
size of 0.′′6 corresponds to a physical extent of .2.3 kpc. The
uGMRT reported the detection of an unresolved radio emission at
650MHzwith a flux density of 700±100 `Jy (Wharton et al. 2021),
while the JVLA detected persistent emission with a flux density of
340 ± 30 `Jy at 3GHz (Ricci et al. 2021). Assuming the estimated
spectral index between these frequencies (∼ −0.5, Ricci et al. 2021),
the 1.3GHz flux density would be ∼ 500 `Jy (similar to the 3-𝜎
upper limit on observations from 1 − 2GHz; Law et al. 2021). The
flux density we measured for FRB 20190714A is a factor of ∼10
lower than FRB20201124A, but FRB 20190714A is also a factor
2.6 more distant. Therefore, the flux densities would be comparable
if they were at similar distances.

Given the resolution of MeerKAT we are unable to definitively
state whether the persistent emission is associated with a
star-forming region or the FRB itself. However, the increased resolution
with the e-MERLIN baselines would tend to favour a compact
source similar to the one observed in FRB 20121102A. One of the
leading models to explain the bursts from, and radio counterpart
to FRB 20121102A, is a young nebula powered flaring magnetar
embedded in a 20–50 year-old supernova remnant (Beloborodov
2017; Metzger et al. 2019). The lack of a bright persistent radio
source associated with the repeater FRB 20180916A suggests that
it is comparatively older at & 200 − 500 years and the persistent
radio source may have faded. In the model by Metzger et al. (2019),
the nebula is suggested to contribute significantly to the rotation
measure and dispersion measure (DM), as well as to the persistent
radio luminosity. These values are expected to decrease on a
timescale of a few decades to centuries. Given the association of a
comparatively fainter persistent source, FRB 20190714A may potentially
be a repeating FRB whose age lies between that of FRB
20121102A and FRB 20180916A. Millisecond magnetars formed
through standard astrophysical channels such as hydrogen poor super-luminous
supernovae and long duration gamma-ray bursts are
consistent with the progenitors of FRBs expected in low-metallicity
dwarf galaxies with high specific star-formation rate such as for
FRB 20121102A. However, Margalit et al. (2019) note that it is also
possible to form such sources through a variety of channels, including
binary neutron star mergers and accretion induced collapse of
white dwarfs in environments and host galaxy demographics different
to FRB 20121102A. Such suggestions are consistent with recent
localisations (e.g. Heintz et al. 2020).

The X-ray and VHE observations with Swift and H.E.S.S.
allows us to probe non-thermal persistent emission associated to
the FRB host galaxy or its source. Recently, H.E.S.S. observed
SGR1935+2154 (H.E.S.S. collaboration 2021) that is a Galactic
magnetar linked to a repeating FRB and its first X-ray counterpart.
MagnetarX-ray flares could in fact be non-thermal in nature (Li et al.
2021) indicating the presence of particle acceleration that could potentially
reach the VHE domain. The inverse Compton process is a
primary candidate for the production ofVHEnon-thermal emission.
H.E.S.S. observations did not lead to a detection of a persistent or a
transient source associated to FRB20171019A. We found no X-ray
counterparts and thus derived the upper limits to constrain these

emissions. In the case of existence of X-ray non-thermal outbursts,
the lack of VHE detection could indicate that inverse Compton is
weak in the vicinity of the magnetars or that the VHE gamma-ray
emission is quenched. This latter scenario could be explained by the
fact that inverse Compton is taking place too close to the magnetar’s
surface, where pair production and photon splitting could be
responsible for significant energy losses (Hu et al. 2019), preventing
energetic particles and photons to reach the nebula.

No persistent emissions were detected towards FRB
20190711A and FRB 20171019A in our MeerKAT observations
(see Figures 7, 8, and 9), therefore no follow up observations were
conducted towards those FRBs.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Several FRB models envision persistent emission to be associated
with these sources. In this paper, we conducted radio observations
of three FRBs (FRB 20190714A, 20190711A and 20171019A),
and also a multi-wavelength campaign on one of these (FRB
20171019A).

We detected persistent compact radio emission associated with
FRB 20190714A (at 𝑧 = 0.2365) using the MeerKAT and e-MERLIN
radio telescope. This represents the first detection of the
radio continuum emission associated with the host (galaxy) of FRB
20190714A and is only the third known FRB to have such an association.
We furthermore obtained a radio upper limit of∼ 15`Jy
beam−1 for the repeating FRBs 20190711A and 20171019A.

We also performed UV, X-ray and VHE observations with the

Swift andH.E.S.S. instruments and obtained upper limits in the three
domains constraining the MWL emissions from FRB20171019A.
The search for FRB MWL counterparts is ongoing within the
H.E.S.S. collaboration and more results will be published in future
works.

Given the association of a comparatively fainter persistent
source, FRB 20190714Amay potentially be a repeating FRBwhose
age lies between that of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916A.
