ABSTRACT

Context. Pieces of empirical evidence suggest the existence of a period-age relation for long-period variables (LPVs). Yet, this
property has hardly been studied on theoretical grounds thus far.
Aims. We aim to examine the period-age relation using the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations.
Methods. We combined isochrone models with theoretical periods to simulate the distribution of fundamental mode LPV pulsators,
which include Miras, in the period-age plane, and we compared it with observations of LPVs in Galactic and Magellanic Clouds’
clusters.
Results. In agreement with observations, models predict that the fundamental mode period decreases with increasing age because of
the dominant role of mass in shaping stellar structure and evolution. At a given age, the period distribution shows a non-negligible
width and is skewed toward short periods, except for young C-rich stars. As a result, the period-age relations of O-rich and C-rich
models are predicted to have different slopes. We derived best-fit relations describing age and initial mass as a function of the
fundamental mode period for both O- and C-rich models.
Conclusions. The study confirms the power of the period-age relations to study populations of LPVs of specific types, either O-rich
or C-rich, on statistical grounds. In doing so, it is recommended not to limit a study to Miras, which would make it prone to selection
biases, but rather to include semi-regular variables that pulsate predominantly in the fundamental mode. The use of the relations to
study individual LPVs, on the other hand, requires more care given the scatter in the period distribution predicted at any given age.

1. Introduction

Low- to intermediate-mass stars approach the end of their lives
through the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) evolutionary phase,
during which they exhibit pulsations with timescales up to several
hundreds of days, and they are hence known as long-period
variables (LPVs). If their V-band amplitude exceeds 2.5 mag,
they are classified as Miras, which have a rather regular periodicity
and they are believed to pulsate only in the radial fundamental
mode (FM). If their photometric amplitude is smaller, they
are known as semi-regular variables (SRVs), which are thought
to be the progenitors of Miras. The name stems from the lesser
degree of regularity of their light curves, likely due to the fact
that they can pulsate in multiple modes simultaneously.

The notion that younger LPVs tend to display longer periods
compared to older ones, often referred to as the period-age (PA)
relation, is rooted in the empirical evidence from stellar kinematics
in the solar neighborhood. The first such piece of evidence
is probably due to Merrill (1923), who pointed out that M-type
LPVs increasingly lag behind the local standard of rest (i.e., possess
a higher asymmetric drift) as their period decreases. Later
studies (as summarized by Wyatt & Cahn 1983) confirmed this
behavior (also using proper motion data, e.g., Wilson & Merrill
1942), and showed that the shorter periods are also accompanied
by a higher velocity dispersion. Furthermore, groups of
LPVs with relatively short periods are characterized by a greater
scale height above the Galactic plane. This was shown, using for

the first time the radial velocity of LPVs in the southern hemisphere,
by Feast (1963). In this seminal paper, Feast realized
that LPVs with shorter periods must be members of older stellar
populations and emphasized their highly promising applications
for both Galactic and extra-galactic studies over a wide range
of stellar ages. It should be noted that the PA relation is connected
with the existence of a period-metallicity relation (Lloyd
Evans & Menzies 1973; Lloyd Evans 1983b; Feast 1981; Feast
& Whitelock 2000a, and references therein).

A number of subsequent works have corroborated the PA
relation on empirical grounds, or have exploited it to interpret
observational results. Relevant examples are studies of LPVs in
globular clusters (e.g., Feast 1966; Lloyd Evans 1983b; Whitelock
1986), toward the galactic center and bulge (Lloyd Evans
1976; Feast et al. 1980; Whitelock et al. 1991) or at high galactic
latitude (Jura & Kleinmann 1992; Whitelock et al. 1994). Of particular
interest is the recent effort to extend the analysis of LPVs
to dwarf galaxies in the Local Group (Menzies et al. 2002, 2008;
Whitelock et al. 2009; Menzies et al. 2010, 2011; Sakamoto et al.
2012; Battinelli & Demers 2012, 2013; Whitelock et al. 2013;
Menzies et al. 2015).

The Hipparcos mission provided the means to refine the results
 on the period-kinematics connection. This was done by
Feast & Whitelock (2000b), who found evidence supporting the
existence of a bar-like structure in the Bulge from the orbits of
local LPVs. A similar study dedicated to C-rich LPVs was performed
by Feast et al. (2006), who provided quantitative age
estimates for these stars. A summary of the main results and
prospects emerging from these Hipparcos-era studies is given by
Feast (2007). More recently, the study of the Galaxy with LPVs
has been stimulated by the wealth of data acquired by large-scale
surveys (e.g., Catchpole et al. 2016; Urago et al. 2020), especially
the Gaia mission (Grady et al. 2019, 2020).

It seems relevant that just a few years after the study of Feast
(1963), Kippenhahn & Smith (1969) predicted the PA relation
of classical Cepheids from stellar evolution and pulsation models.
The theoretical modeling of Cepheids and of their periodluminosity
(PL) and PA relations is now an active field of research
(e.g., Bono et al. 2005; Anderson et al. 2016; De Somma
et al. 2020). In contrast, when it comes to theoretical assessments
of the LPV PA relation, the literature is surprisingly scarce (especially
in comparison with the significant effort put into empirical
studies). In fact, we were able to identify only two relevant studies
addressing this subject (Wyatt & Cahn 1983; Eggen 1998).
The discrepancy in period predictions between linear and nonlinear
pulsation models (e.g., Ya’Ari & Tuchman 1996; Lebzelter
& Wood 2005; Trabucchi et al. 2021b), and more generally the
difficulty in modeling the structure of evolved red giants, likely
played a role in hampering the theoretical investigation of the PA
relation of LPVs.

Motivated by the release of updated AGB evolutionary models
(Pastorelli et al. 2019, 2020) and the availability of new, accurate
model predictions for the FM period of AGB stars (Trabucchi
et al. 2019, 2021b), we decided to investigate the nature
of the PA relation of LPVs on theoretical grounds. The adopted
models and observed data are described in Sect. 2, while in
Sect. 3 we present the results, which are discussed in Sect. 4.
We summarize our conclusions in Sect. 5.

2. Methods

2.1. Models

We employed PARSEC-COLIBRI isochrones (Marigo et al.
2017) with stellar evolutionary models from Pastorelli et al.
(2019, 2020) for the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch
(TP-AGB) phase, and from PARSEC (Bressan et al. 2012, version
1.2S) for the preceding evolution. The adopted set of
isochrones covers the range 0.001 to 0.016 in initial metallicity
(Zi), with a 0.001 step, while it spans the age interval
8.00 ≤ log(τ/yr) ≤ 10.45 with a step of 0.05. Since the AGB
phase is short-lived, it only spans a small range of initial masses
for each given isochrone, of order of 10−2 M⊙ at most.

The adopted isochrones include linear pulsation periods from
Trabucchi et al. (2019) for overtone modes and nonlinear periods
computed with the period-mass-radius relation from Trabucchi
et al. (2021b) for the FM1. Pulsation properties were computed
along both the early-AGB and the TP-AGB. We did not extend
our analysis to red supergiant stars as the pulsation prescription
we employed are strictly valid only below 7 M⊙.

We recall that, with the adopted nonlinear relation, the period
increases with radius (R) as a broken power law, whose exponent
decreases as soon as the “bending radius” Rb is exceeded, it and
becomes zero when the “saturation radius” Rs > Rb is reached
(i.e., the period becomes independent of radius). The exact values
of Rb and Rs, as well as of the exponents, depend on the
current mass (M). We assume that the FM is dominant if the
stellar radius is larger than the critical value Rdom,0, which we
computed from the current stellar mass using Eq. 4 of Trabucchi
et al. (2021b).

1 Hereinafter, whenever we discuss periods, it should be understood
that we refer to FM periods on which this work is focused.

2.2. Data

As a first set of data, we considered the cluster-LPV pairs used
by Grady et al. (2019, see their tables 1 and 2). These consist of
19 clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, hosting a total of 20
potential LPV members, and eight Galactic clusters each hosting
a potential LPV member.

We expanded this list with data for LPVs in a few populous
clusters, namely the Galactic clusters NGC 362, NGC 2808, 47
Tuc (NGC 104), andω Cen (NGC 5139); the LMC clusters NGC
1978 and NGC 1846; and the cluster NGC 419 in the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC). The source lists were taken from Lebzelter
& Wood (2005, 2007, 2011, 2016) and Kamath et al. (2010),
whose notation for the sources names is adopted here. After excluding
the star LW3 in NGC 1846 and the star V129 in ω Cen,
which are unlikely cluster members (cf. Lebzelter & Wood 2007,
2016), we reached a total of 203 sources.

The aforementioned studies also provide a lot of information,
possibly including JHK photometry, one or more periods,
and a spectral type. In order to expand on the available data,
we crossmatched the selected sample with the Two Micron AllSky
Survey (2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006), the all-sky data
release of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (AllWISE,
Cutri et al. 2013), the catalog of variable stars from the AllSky
Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN Jayasinghe
et al. 2020), the catalogs of LPVs in the Magellanic Clouds from
the third phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment
(OGLE-III, Soszyński et al. 2009, 2011), the early third data release
from the Gaia mission (Gaia EDR3, Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2021), and the catalog of LPV candidates from Gaia DR2
(Mowlavi et al. 2018).

Following Grady et al. (2019), we took ages from
Kharchenko et al. (2016) and Baumgardt et al. (2013) for clusters
in the Galaxy and LMC, respectively, thereby ensuring that ages
would be homogeneously derived for clusters in both galaxies.
Age uncertainties from Baumgardt et al. (2013), provided for
each cluster, are generally around σlog(τ) ' 0.05. Kharchenko
et al. (2016) do not provide age uncertainties, but a reasonable
upper limit for their method should be σlog(τ) = 0.2 based on
the analysis of Kharchenko et al. (2005) (the same value was
adopted by Grady et al. 2019, in their Fig. 7).

As discussed by Kamath et al. (2010), the age of the SMC
cluster NGC 419 is believed to be around 1.4-1.6 Gyr. This is
consistent with the value τ = 1.45 ± 0.05 Gyr from Goudfrooij
et al. (2014), while it is as young as τ ' 0.89 ± 0.015 Gyr according
to Perren et al. (2017). Since an accurate estimate is not
necessary for our exploratory analysis, we took a rough average
and assumed log(τ/yr) = 9.1 ± 0.1. NGC 419 and NGC 1846
likely exhibit TP-AGB boosting (Girardi et al. 2013). We note
that some clusters show multiple stellar populations, whose age
spread has been estimated in some cases (e.g., Mackey & Broby
Nielsen 2007; Joo & Lee 2013; Villanova et al. 2014) and is consistent
with the age uncertainties we adopted.

Distances of Galactic clusters were also taken from
Kharchenko et al. (2016), while for the Magellanic Clouds and
their clusters we adopted the distance moduli µLMC = 18.49 ±
0.09 mag and µSMC = 18.96 ± 0.02 mag from de Grijs et al.
(2017). We searched for data on interstellar extinction from several
literature works (e.g., Nayak et al. 2016; Kharchenko et al.
2016; Perren et al. 2017), all of which suggest that extinction
in the Ks filter is smaller than ∼ 0.1 mag for most of the clusters
we considered, and at most as large as ∼ 0.3 mag, which is
negligible for our purposes.

A detailed membership verification is beyond the scope of
this work, and we relied on the checks performed by authors
whose source lists we adopted. It should be kept in mind that
some sources may not be real cluster members.

For sources without a spectral type, we used the Gaia2MASS
diagram (Lebzelter et al. 2018, 2019) to determine
whether they are O- or C-rich. We used the near-infrared period-luminosity
diagram to identify the most likely pulsation mode
associated with each period of each observed source. We selected
only FM periods and rejected long secondary periods and
periods attributed to overtone mode pulsation. The details of
these classification steps are provided in Appendix A. Out of
203 sources from the initial list, we identified 95 LPVs pulsating
in the FM, consisting of 40 C-rich and 55 O-rich sources.
They consist of 29 Miras, 33 semi-regular variables, and 33 other
sources (most likely LPVs) whose variability type has not been
determined. We note that, with the exception of Gaia DR2, the
sources of variability data considered here do not report the uncertainty
associated with observed periods. However, since periods
were derived in most cases from well-sampled, high-quality
variability observations, relative period uncertainties are most
likely negligible compared with those associated with age.

3. Results

Panel (a) of Fig. 1 shows a comparison between model predictions
and observations in the PFM–log(τ/yr) plane. The former
are displayed by a density map showing the expected number
NFM of LPVs pulsating in the FM in each period-age bin, normalized
to maximum. Model predictions are in good agreement
with data derived from observations (i.e., individual LPVs in
clusters, represented by symbols), and they show that the period
of LPVs pulsating in the FM decreases with increasing age.
Crosses mark the average properties of the three groups of C-rich
LPVs from Feast et al. (2006, their table 4), which fit the
general pattern with the exception of their group 3, estimated to
be older than what our models predict at P ' 650.

We also show a linear best-fit to the models distribution
(weighted by NFM), which shows a fairly good agreement with
the best-fit to observations by Grady et al. (2019, also shown).
However, the best-fit line does not fully capture the properties
of the predictions, nor of the observed trend. Indeed, models are
indicative of a substantial dispersion around the relation. For instance,
at 1 Gyr, the FM period ranges from ∼ 200 days to ∼ 550
days. Conversely, LPVs pulsating in the FM with a period of 350
days are predicted to be at least ∼200 Myr old, but they can be as
old as ∼3 Gyr. Observed data are consistent with the predicted
spread, although the agreement cannot be considered as the observed
sample adopted is not complete.

Nonetheless, it is relevant that some clusters host multiple
LPVs, which are thus almost coeval, and they do span a wide
period range. Some of these clusters host multiple stellar populations
that are believed to have formed over a time comparable
with the age uncertainties we adopted. This means that longerperiod
(more massive) LPVs in these clusters probably lean toward
the lower age limit assumed for their host cluster, and the
opposite is true at shorter periods. This tends to strengthen the
agreement between models and observations.

Our data set samples the intermediate-age range (NGC 419
and NGC 1846) relatively well as well as old ages (ω Cen, 47
Tuc, NGC 362, and NGC 2808). This provides us with the opportunity
to study the period distribution at these ages, and for
a more detailed comparison between models and observations.

On the basis of the average age of these two groups of clusters
and the associated uncertainty, and taking the discrete age
sampling of the isochrones into account, we considered the age
ranges log(τ/yr) = 9.15±0.10 and log(τ/yr) = 10.10±0.20. Period
distributions at those ages are displayed in panels (b) and (c)
of Fig. 1, respectively, showing good agreement between model
predictions and observations. We note that in both cases, the distribution
is skewed toward short periods, which seems to be true
at all ages for O-rich stars. This can be seen in panel (a) of Fig. 2,
which is a version of the PA plane limited to an O-rich composition2.
Indeed, although at τ . 5 Gyr the observed sample is
very scarce, it appears to be consistent with models predicting a
more densely populated region in the shorter-period half of the
PA distribution.

The case of C-stars, shown in panel (b) of Fig. 2, is different.
They only form over a restricted range of initial masses
and ages, so their occurrence in a given stellar population is an
age indicator on its own. Toward the low-mass (old age) side
of the C-star regime, the behavior is similar to the O-rich case
with a concentration around relatively short periods. C-rich models
tend to have a lower surface temperature and larger radii,
at a given mass, compared to O-rich models, and thus they attain
longer periods more easily. This occurs in particular toward
higher masses, so that younger C-rich models are more concentrated
at longer periods, leading to a steeper PA relation compared
with the O-rich case. These predictions agree with observations
on the old side of the period distribution, while the
scarcity of C stars at τ ' 0.6 Gyr prevents us from performing a
comparison at younger ages.

In appendix B, we provide analytic PA relations by fitting the
high-density parts of the O- and C-rich models’ distribution. We
emphasize that, because of the large scatter of the relation, ages
estimated in this way for individual LPVs are bound to be highly
uncertain. As a way to assess the error in age determination, we
also provide analytic best-fit relations to the boundaries of the
PA distribution of the models in the appendix. These relations
are displayed in Fig. 2.

4. Discussion

In general agreement with observations, models confirm that
LPVs pulsating predominantly in the FM follow a PA relation,
which exhibits a non-negligible dispersion. Thanks to the newly
available nonlinear period predictions, we were able to better examine
the nature of this relation and the origin of its scatter.

The PA relation is intimately connected with the PL relation,
both patterns emerging because of the prominent role of mass in
shaping stellar structure and evolution. Indeed, stellar mass determines
the lifetimes of the main evolutionary stages, and thus
the age of stars in the AGB phase. Pulsation models (Trabucchi
et al. 2021b) show that the radius Rdom,0 (and corresponding
luminosity) at the onset of dominant FM pulsation (DFMP)
increases with mass, so that the most massive FM-dominated
LPVs are brighter. They also have longer periods, as this increases
with radius. In other words, the period, luminosity, and
age near the tip of the AGB are all functions of initial stellar
mass (at least to a good approximation).

We note that this would not be the case if the FM were dominant
along the entire AGB, as the large change in radius during
this phase would result in a wide range of periods at a given age.
It is the very fact that DFMP occurs only during the final portion

2 A further version of the PA plane highlighting both chemical types
can be found in Fig. A.2 of appendix A.1.

Fig. 1. Period-age diagram. Panel (a) shows the predicted period-age distribution (darker tones indicate a higher expected number of LPVs on
a linear scale, normalized to maximum). Symbols represent observed LPVs (green: SRVs; purple: Miras; white: unclassified) with the shape
indicating their host cluster or literature source as indicated in the legend. The age uncertainties are marked by the error bars. The groups of
galactic C-stars of Feast et al. (2006) are marked by crosses annotated with the group number. The solid and dotted line represent a linear best-fit
to models and the best-fit by Grady et al. (2019), respectively. Period distributions at selected ages are compared in panels (b) and (c) and marked
in panel (a) by the blue and red shaded areas (at log(τ/yr) ∼ 9.15 and ∼ 10.10, respectively). For clarity, the effect of the TP-AGB boosting is
suppressed in panel (a).

Fig. 2. Similar to Fig. 1, but limited to O-rich (left panel) and C-rich (right panel) LPVs. The solid line marks the best fit to the models, while
dashed lines are best fits to the edges of the model distribution (see the text for more details).

of the AGB that limits the range of periods a FM-pulsating LPV
can have at a given age. Yet, the DFMP part of the AGB is long
enough for significant variations in radius to occur, which result
in the dispersion of the PA relation seen in Fig. 1.

At a given initial metallicity Zi, the shape of the period distribution
primarily results from the fact that, throughout the TPAGB
(the stage during which the FM is normally excited), the
envelope expansion accelerates, while the period becomes progressively
less sensitive to changes in radius (see Appendix C).
In particular, the slope of the period-radius relation decreases
sharply at Pb = P(Rb). The FM period distribution is roughly
symmetric around that value, but at its short-period side, the FM
is not dominant. Therefore, when only FM-dominated LPVs are
considered, as is done here, the observed period distribution appears
skewed toward short periods.

This feature is strengthened when a set of isochrones is considered
 which spans a range of initial metallicities because the
adopted criterion for the onset of DFMP does not depend on
metallicity, but the FM period does as metal-poor LPVs are
warmer and have smaller radii compared with metal-rich ones.
As a consequence, the bulk of the period distribution of metalpoor
LPVs is at periods shorter than Pb, so they only contribute
to the global distribution (i.e., at all Zi at a given age) over a
small period range at P & Pb. In contrast, metal-rich LPVs have
periods well beyond Pb, so they contribute both at that value and
at longer periods. The result is an excess of FM-dominated LPVs
near Pb, that is to say on the short side of the overall period distribution.

We note that, in contrast with the prescription we adopted,
the onset of DFMP in reality is probably sensitive to metallicity.
While the good degree of agreement with observations suggests
that the dependence is weak at most, it is possible for
any discrepancy to be smeared out by the fact that our set of
isochrone implicitly assumes a flat star-formation rate with no
age-metallicity relation, so it is not an accurate representation of
any realistic stellar environment. In this sense, the PA relation is
environment-dependent, and it is not necessarily universal.

A further point of uncertainty stems from the fact that the
prescription we adopted assumes that the FM period only depends
upon the mass and radius, and that it is affected by a
change in composition only through the effect that such a variation
has on the radius. While this is true to a good approximation,
linear models show a small dependence of periods on metallicity
at a fixed mass and radius, but the quantitative impact in the
nonlinear case is unknown. We can only estimate, based on the
results of Trabucchi et al. (2019), an uncertainty of ±10% at most
with respect to the prescriptions adopted here.

Qualitatively, a realistic age-metallicity relation and the
metallicity dependence of the period and of the onset of DFMP
are all expected to result in a steeper PA relation than the one
we predict, but it is difficult to assess the relative importance of
these effects. In this sense, the composition probably affects the
shape of the PA relation more than its dispersion. The latter is
likely affected by the composition indirectly through mass loss,
the analysis of which is beyond the scope of this study. However,
we point out that mass loss represents a source of scatter in
combination with the occurrence of thermal pulses, because it reduces
the minimum radius for the onset of DFMP. Thus, during
the luminosity dips associated with thermal pulses, a LPV can
have a period shorter than the one it had when it first entered the
DFMP regime (see Appendix C). An additional source of uncertainty,
which we disregarded, is rotation (or other processes that
induce extra mixing in the core) which causes a spread in ages
at a given initial mass (cf. Anderson et al. 2016, for the case of
classical Cepheids).

The fairly good agreement between models and observations
encourages the use of LPVs as age indicators, but the scatter of
the PA relation hampers this application. We attempted to reduce
the scatter through corrections involving photometric properties,
as is customarily done for classical Cepheids with a color term
(e.g., Bono et al. 2005), but with unsatisfactory results. A correction
dependent on the photometric amplitude of variability represents
a promising alternative, but it cannot be pursued at the
moment. Indeed, for computational efficiency, current pulsation
models include only a crude treatment of the atmospheric layers
as they do not affect pulsation periods. On the other hand, the
atmosphere is crucial in determining the spectral energy distribution
and its variation throughout the pulsation cycle, and hence
the amplitude of variability. At the same time, the observational
sample adopted here is too heterogeneous for a self-consistent
investigation of amplitude, but this kind of study could be made
possible by the upcoming data release 3 of the Gaia mission
(Gaia Collaboration et al. 2021) and the future Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST, Ivezić et al. 2019) of the Vera Rubin
Observatory.

It is worth noting that our analysis applies to Miras as well
as SRVs, provided that they predominantly pulsate in the FM.
The limitation of PA relation studies to Miras, as has mainly
been done in literature so far, undoubtedly has some advantages:
to begin with, the fact that Miras are typically easier to
detect than SRVs, and their light curves are easier to process
as they tend to be more regular. Moreover, Miras represent the
end-point of AGB evolution, so in principle they correspond to a
smaller range of stellar parameters compared to the full extent of

the DFMP regime, and they display a smaller range of periods
at a given age (cf. Feast & Whitelock 2000b). In other words,
they should exhibit a relatively narrow PA relation (even though,
based on the observational data set we adopted, there is no conclusive
evidence that considering only Miras reduces the scatter
of the PA relation).

Nonetheless, we caution against this approach as it is prone
to introducing uncontrolled biases, as the traditional distinction
between SRVs and Miras is arbitrary (see Trabucchi et al. 2021a,
and references therein). As such, it disregards the physical processes
at the origin of the range of amplitudes characterizing
LPVs. In particular, photometric amplitudes are largely determined
by the formation and dissociation of molecules in the stellar
atmosphere, and they are likely to be metallicity-dependent.
It is therefore reasonable to assume that metal-poor (old) Mira
analogs might be classified as SRVs, thereby undermining the
potential application of the PA relation if restricted to Miras.
This seems to be supported by the fact that the bulk of old LPVs
in our sample are classified as SRVs. Therefore, studies involving
PA relations of LPVs would advantageously include both
Miras and FM-pulsating SRVs.

The challenge associated with SRVs stems from the fact that
they are often multiperiodic (even when predominantly pulsating
in the FM), a property that complicates the light curve analysis
and period extraction. At the same time, this feature could
potentially improve age determinations as overtone modes are
expected to display a PA relation as well.

5. Conclusions

We used the results from recent nonlinear pulsation calculations
and combined them with state-of-the-art isochrone models to investigate
the PA relation of FM-dominated LPVs, finding good
agreement with the distribution of observed LPVs in star clusters.
The theoretical PA relation displays a non-negligible scatter,
whose origin we identified due to the fact that, despite being
very brief, the portion of AGB evolution during which the FM
becomes dominant shows a relatively large range in mass and
radius at a given age.

The theoretical distribution of FM periods is roughly symmetric,
but the FM is not dominant at the shortest periods. As a
result, models predict that the distribution of dominant FM periods
at a given age is skewed toward short periods, in agreement
with observations. Depending on stellar populations, metallicity
may enhance this feature as metal-poor LPVs, which tend to be
warmer and more compact, only contribute near short periods.

We provide the best-fit PA relation separately for O-rich and
C-rich FM-pulsating LPVs. The latter LPVs show a steeper PA
relation because of their lower surface temperatures, which allow
them to reach longer periods more easily.

Our analysis concerns all LPVs predominantly pulsating in
the FM, regardless of whether they are classified as Miras or
SRVs. We discourage such a distinction in that it is arbitrary and
prone to selection biases that risk compromising the use of LPVs
as age indicators.

The main limitation in the use of the PA relation for age determinations
of individual LPVs stems from its relatively large
scatter. We suggest that corrective terms, involving the amplitude
of variability, might help to reduce this scatter and anticipate
that upcoming data from ongoing and future surveys dedicated
to time-domain astronomy will be highly valuable to probe
this possibility. A study of the impact of metallicity on nonlinear
pulsation is highly desirable to pursue this line of investigation,
as would be a theoretical investigation of the dependence of photometric
amplitudes upon global stellar parameters.

Fig. A.1. Absolute-Ks Gaia-2MASS diagram for the stars with or without
a spectral type (left and right panels, respectively) in the selected
sample. Symbol colors and shapes indicate the spectral type and host
cluster described in the legend, respectively, which also reports the number
of sources displayed (i.e., having both optical and NIR photometry).
The dashed line marks the separation between O- and C-rich sources
according to Lebzelter et al. (2018). An arrow marks the source MSX
LMC 124 in NGC 1830 that, having WBP,RP−WJ,Ks = 9.73 mag, lies outside
the plot area. Background dots are LPVs in the LMC from OGLEIII
(light gray) and Mowlavi et al. (2018) (darker gray).

Appendix A: Classification of observed LPVs

Appendix A.1: Spectral type

We adopted the spectral types provided by Lebzelter & Wood
(2007) and Kamath et al. (2010) for 52 of the LPVs they studied
in NGC 1846, NGC 1978, and NGC 419. The only exception
is the star 5-3 in NGC 419, for which we adopted the S-type as
reported by Lloyd Evans (1983a).

We also searched the SIMBAD astronomical database
(Wenger et al. 2000) for spectral type information, which we
found for 26 more stars. We used the Gaia-2MASS diagram of
Lebzelter et al. (2018) to confirm the chemical type classification
taken from literature and to characterize the surface chemistry of
sources of an unknown spectral type (see Fig. A.1). Among the
latter, we identified 13 C-rich stars and 106 O-rich sources.

Three of the sources without a spectral type lack Gaia photometry,
so they cannot be classified with the Gaia-2MASS. Two
of them (LW5 and LW22 in 47 Tuc) have no match in Gaia
EDR3, but they have NIR data and are probably O-rich based on
their position in the J − Ks versus Ks color-magnitude diagram.
The third source is one of the two stars in NGC 1903 from the
list of Grady et al. (2019), which we identified with the 2MASS
source J05171633-6920298. It is likely C-rich according to the
NIR color-magnitude diagram.

Finally, the sources V138 in ω Cen, LW15 in NGC 2808,
and LW4 in NGC 362 lack NIR data. They cannot be placed in
the NIR PL diagram, upon which we relied to assign pulsation
modes to periods, so we excluded them from the sample. The

distribution of O- and C-rich sources in the period-age diagram
is shown in Fig. A.2.

Appendix A.2: Variability

For variability information, we complemented the data from
Lebzelter & Wood and Kamath et al. (2010) with the catalogs
from OGLE-III, ASAS-SN, and Gaia DR2. Combining these
data sets, we found at least one period for each of the 176 sources
in our sample.

In order to identify the pulsation mode most likely responsible
for periods in a given source, we assumed that the second
overtone mode is associated with sequence A, the first overtone
mode with sequences B and C′, and the fundamental mode with
sequence C (e.g., Trabucchi et al. 2017). We excluded long secondary
periods on sequence D as they are not due to stellar pulsation
(Soszyński et al. 2021, and references therein), and we
used the pattern of PL sequences in the LMC as a reference to
guide the mode identification (cf. Trabucchi et al. 2021a).

We performed this classification separately for periods coming
from each distinct data set. If two or more periods from different
data sets were assigned to the same pulsation mode, we
retained only one of those periods, with priority to the values
from Lebzelter & Wood and Kamath et al. (2010). If the latter
authors do not provide this information, we adopted the period
from OGLE-III if available, and otherwise from ASAS-SN or
from Gaia DR2.

For some sources, the periods reported in different catalogs
were assigned to the same mode through this procedure. In most
cases, these periods are reasonably similar to each other. Only
in a few cases were they significantly different, but this did not
alter our conclusions.

When available, the variability type was taken from OGLE-III
 or ASAS-SN. We note that we are only interested in whether
a star is classified as a Mira or semi-regular variable. In many
cases, this type is not given or the star is simply considered, for
instance, as an LPV or AGB in SIMBAD, in which case we considered
the variability type as undetermined.

Appendix B: Fitting relations

We obtained analytic expressions for the PA relations separately
for O- and C-rich stars, proceeding as follows. For each bin of
log(τ/yr), we modeled the period distribution with a Gaussian
kernel density estimator (KDE) and identified the peak of the
distribution. To describe the boundaries of the PA relation, we
adopted, at each age, the values of the period at which the distribution
equals 25% of its maximum. We selected this arbitrary
value upon visual inspection of the PA plane. We modeled the
central trend of the PA relation, as well as its short- and longperiod
edges, with linear or quadratic functions in the form

log(τ/yr) = a0 + a1 (P/P̃) + a2 (P/P̃)2 , (B.1)

(where P̃ = 350 days) and employed a Lenvenberg-Marquardt
nonlinear regression algorithm3 to derive the best-fit coefficients,
which are listed in Table B.1. We remark that these best-fit expressions
are only valid in the intervals 8.0 ≤ log(τ/yr) ≤ 10.3
and 20 < P/days < 700 for O-rich composition, and within

3 We made use of the Python library SciPy to perform Gaussian KDE
modeling and best-fit, respectively, by means of the gaussian_kde
tool from the stats module and the curve_fit function from the
optimize module.

Fig. A.2. Similar to Fig. 1, except each source is color-coded according to whether it has been classified as O-rich (blue) or C-rich (red).

the form given in Eq. B.1.

C-rich

lower edge 9.982 -1.698
upper edge 8.498 -1.827 -0.9959

8.6 ≤ log(τ/yr) ≤ 9.3 and 140 < P/days < 620 in the C-rich
case.

Because of the connection between age and initial mass, the
PA relation can be translated into a period-initial mass relation,
which we derived using the same approach described above, and
assuming the form

log(Mi/M⊙) = b0 + b1 (P/P̃) + b2 (P/P̃)2 . (B.2)

The resulting best-fit lines are displayed in Fig. B.1, and the coefficients
are given in Table B.2.

We remark that both the PA and the period-initial mass relations
depend on model assumptions, in particular mass loss and
mixing, as well as on the properties of the population of LPVs,
namely the star-formation history and age-metallicity relation.

Appendix C: The shape of the period distribution

As an example case, we consider an isochrone of age log(τ/yr) =
8.3 and initial metallicity Zi = 0.006. Stars on the TP-AGB have
initial masses Mi ' 3.85 M⊙ over a small range of ∼ 10−3 M⊙.
The relation between period and initial mass is displayed in
panel (a) of Fig. C.1, where isochrone portions undergoing

DFMP are indicated by solid lines. Panel (b) shows the period
distributions for a few different cases.

It is instructive, to begin with, to ignore the effect of thermal
pulses and consider only the quiescent evolution (green lines in
Fig. C.1). The smallest initial mass corresponds to a star that just
entered the TP-AGB, when the FM has a period of ∼ 240 days
but is not dominant. It only becomes dominant above a threshold
radius Rdom,0, that is for periods longer than a (mass-dependent)
critical period Pdom,0 (the solid gray line in Fig. C.1). The least
evolved (quiescent) model with dominant FM has PFM ' 360
days (green circle and horizontal line), corresponding to a sharp
cut in the period distribution shown in panel (b) of Fig. C.1.

As a star evolves along the AGB it expands, and its period becomes
longer in response to the increase in radius. Models with
a higher initial mass are more evolved, hence they have a larger
radius and a longer period. The rate at which a period increases
with radius is not fixed, but rather decreases with evolution. According
to the prescription of Trabucchi et al. (2021b), a period
grows with radius as a broken power-law with exponent α ' 1.8
if R < Rb, and with α ' 1.25 at larger radii.

This is equivalent to saying that the period grows more
slowly after it exceeds a critical value Pb = P(Rb), marked by
the gray dotted line in Fig. C.1. The isochrone reaches it at

Fig. B.1. Similar to Fig. 2, but showing initial mass Mi in place of age. The best-fit lines to the most populated band and edges of the theoretical
PFM – Mi relation are shown.

Fig. C.1. Period distribution at fixed age and metallicity. Panel (a) shows
period as a function of initial mass (current mass on the top axis) on the
TP-AGB for a ∼ 200 Myr old isochrone with Zi = 0.006. Red lines
show full thermal pulses, while blue lines ignore luminosity spikes and
green lines show only the quiescent evolution. The same color code
is used for the period distributions (normalized to their maximum) on
panel (b). Solid lines indicate that the FM is dominant. Circles indicate
the earliest onset of DFMP accounting for (red) or ignoring (green)
luminosity spikes, and the shortest period of the dominant FM (blue).
Gray lines mark the critical values of periods at which the FM becomes
dominant (solid line), less sensitive to radius (dotted line, which occurs
at the vertical line for this specific isochrone), and independent of radius
(dashed line).

Mi ' 3.8524 M⊙ (vertical gray line), when PFM ' 420 days. In
models with a smaller initial mass, the period is still increasing
at a relatively large rate as the envelope expands, while in more
massive models the period has already become less sensitive to
changes in radius. This is reflected by a slight inflection of the
green curve, which corresponds to the maximum in the period
distribution shown in panel (b) of Fig. C.1. The period distribution
of the full TP-AGB range is roughly symmetric around
this maximum, while limiting the selection to DFMP, produces
a distribution skewed toward short periods, as found in Sect. 3.

If the luminosity dips following thermal pulses are taken
into account (blue lines), the corresponding envelope contraction
causes the period to decrease, and the cut at ∼ 360 days
becomes less sharp. Because of mass loss, the threshold period
Pdom,0 is lowered, so that the shortest period associated with
DFMP does not correspond to the least evolved model (green
circle), but rather to the luminosity dip of a thermal pulse (blue
circle).

To be precise, the earliest occurrence of DFMP is on the leftmost
luminosity spike (red circle), whose duration is so short that
it is unlikely to be observed. Indeed, the inclusion of luminosity
spikes alters the period distribution at long periods very little.
Luminosity spikes are relevant only for relatively massive and
young TP-AGB stars, and they give rise to the poorly populated
portion of the PA relation at the longest periods, as seen in panel
(a) of Fig. 2.
