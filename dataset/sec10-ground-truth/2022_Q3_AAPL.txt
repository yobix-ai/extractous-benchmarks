Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 span 52 weeks each. Unless
otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’s hedged term debt– and marketable securities–related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized
within 20 years.
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021 were as follows (in millions):

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 36% and 42% of total trade receivables as of June 25, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.

subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of June 25, 2022, the
Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 12%. As of

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding
the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or
periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the
“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate
governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form
10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Quarterly Highlights
Total net sales increased 2% or $1.5 billion during the third quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by higher net sales of
Services and iPhone, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar had an unfavorable impact on all Products and Services net sales during the third quarter of 2022.
At the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company introduced an all-new MacBook Air and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro , both powered by the new
Apple M2 chip. The Company also announced iOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to its operating systems that are expected to be
available in the fall of 2022.
The Company repurchased $21.7 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the third quarter of 2022.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented
measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19
pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19
pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19
pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.

The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk
Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

Total operating expenses $ 12,809 $ 11,129 $ 38,144 $ 32,499
Percentage of total net sales 15 % 14 % 13 % 12 %
Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and professional services. The Company continues to believe that
focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products
and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was
driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and professional services.
Other Income/(Expense), Net
Other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26, 2021 was as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
June 25,

Other income/(expense), net (13) 189 (65) 585
Total other income/(expense), net $ (10) $ 243 (104)% $ (97) $ 796 (112)%
OI&E decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 due primarily to fair value adjustments and
realized losses on marketable securities and higher interest expense, partially offset by foreign exchange gains.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and nine-month periods ended June 25, 2022 and June 26,
2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended
June 25,
2022
June 26,

Provision for income taxes $ 3,624 $ 2,625 $ 15,364 $ 11,830
Effective tax rate 15.7 % 10.8 % 16.3 % 13.8 %
Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 %
The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower
effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit, partially offset by state
income taxes.
Apple Inc. | Q3 2022 Form 10-Q | 18

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on
foreign earnings and an adjustment to prior years’ foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of
2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, lower tax benefits from share-based
compensation, and the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of June 25, 2022, the
Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $43.1 billion, with $43.0 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). The
Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 25, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per
share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s
critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first nine months of 2022. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market
risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2021 Form
10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of June 25, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2022, which were identified in connection with
management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the
Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The
Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to
nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern
California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an
injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the third quarter of 2022 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock, can be affected by a number of
factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any
one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of
the Company’s stock, can be materially and adversely affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2021 Form 10-K.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

(1) On April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Program. As of
June 25, 2022, total utilization under the April 2022 authorization was $4.1 billion. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company also utilized the final $17.6
billion under the $90 billion Program authorization approved in April 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.
Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1
under the Exchange Act.
