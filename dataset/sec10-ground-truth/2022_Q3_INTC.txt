The Organization of Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
The order and presentation of content in our Form 10-Q differs from the traditional SEC Form 10-Q format. Our format is designed to improve readability and better present how we
organize and manage our business. See "Form 10-Q Cross-Reference Index" within Other Key Information for a cross-reference index to the traditional SEC Form 10-Q format.
We have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-Q in "Key Terms" within Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.
The preparation of our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements is in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Our Form 10-Q includes key metrics that we use to measure our business, some
of which are non-GAAP measures. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD&A for an explanation of these measures and why management uses them and believes they provide
investors with useful supplemental information.

A Quarter in Review
Total revenue of $15.3 billion was down $3.9 billion year over year or 20%, as CCG revenue decreased 17%, DCAI revenue decreased 27%, and NEX revenue increased 14%. Q3 2022
results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment that continues to deteriorate, with slowing consumer demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we
believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. CCG revenue was down on lower Notebook volume in the consumer and education
market segments, though Notebook ASPs were higher due to a resulting change in product mix. DCAI Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers
tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a
competitive environment. NEX revenue increased primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products,
partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon.

Lower gross margin from lower
revenue, higher unit cost, higher
inventory reserves, and higher
period charges from ramp of Intel 4

Lower EPS from lower gross
margin, higher operating expenses
from additional investment in R&D
and higher losses on equity
investments, partially offset by a
tax benefit on the operating loss.
Lower operating cash flow driven by
lower income after adjusting for
non-cash items, including the gain
on the sale of McAfee and the pretax gain from the divestiture of our
NAND business; also affected by
unfavorable working capital
changes.
Key Developments
▪ We began high-volume manufacturing of Sapphire Rapids, Raptor Lake, and Ponte Vecchio and expect to begin shipping to customers in Q4 2022.
▪ We introduced the Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series for the intelligent visual cloud, which provides a GPU solution built to flexibly handle a wide range of workloads and helps
lower and optimize the total cost of ownership for diverse cloud workloads. We also announced the 12th Gen Intel® Core™ SoC processors for IoT Edge, a new lineup of purposebuilt edge products optimized for IoT applications, and we revealed the 13th Gen Intel® Core™ processor family with six new unlocked desktop processors with up to 24 cores and
32 threads and clock speeds up to 5.8 GHz for leading gaming, streaming and recording experiences.
▪ We announced the Semiconductor Co-Investment Program (SCIP), a program which introduces a new funding model to the capital-intensive semiconductor industry. As part of this
program, we signed a definitive agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield). SCIP is an element of our Smart Capital approach, which aims to provide innovative
ways to fund growth and accelerate our IDM 2.0 strategy. This arrangement represents an equity partnership whereby we and Brookfield will own 51% and 49%, respectively, of
what will be a newly-formed entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), which we will fully consolidate into our consolidated financial statements. We expect Arizona Fab will spend up to
$30.0 billion of investments in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona where we will be the sole operator of the two new chip factories,
which will support long-term demand for our products and provide capacity for IFS customers. The definitive agreement includes provisions that require us to utilize these two new
chip factories at specified minimum levels or be subject to penalties.
▪ We expect Mobileye to receive net proceeds of approximately $0.9 billion from completing their IPO and concurrent private placement in Q4 2022. At closing, we expect to own
roughly 94% of their common stock and to continue to consolidate their results.

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with U.S. GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied
in our 2021 Form 10-K and as updated by our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we
experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair
statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2021 Form 10-K where we include
additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
Note 2 : Operating Segments
We previously announced several organizational changes that would accelerate the execution and innovation of our Company by allowing us to capture growth in both large traditional
markets and high-growth emerging markets. This includes reorganization of our business units to capture this growth and to provide increased transparency, focus and accountability. As
a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2022 to align to the previously-announced business reorganization. All prior-period segment data has been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information, and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2022.
We now manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪ Client Computing (CCG)
▪ Datacenter and AI (DCAI)
▪ Network and Edge (NEX)
▪ Accelerated Computing Systems and Graphics (AXG)
▪ Mobileye
▪ Intel Foundry Services (IFS)
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone
SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel architecture.
CCG, DCAI and NEX are our reportable operating segments. AXG, Mobileye, and IFS do not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we
have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. AXG revenue includes integrated graphics royalties from our CCG and NEX operating segments and
are recorded as if the sales or transfers were to third parties at prices that approximate market-based selling prices. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the
sponsoring operating segment.
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪ historical results of operations from divested businesses;
▪ results of operations of start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
▪ amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
▪ employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments (beginning the first quarter of 2022, this includes all of our
stock-based compensation); and
▪ acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.

Table of Contents
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating
income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the
interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products are then sold across
multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do
not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses operating
income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as
a whole. There have been no changes to our segment accounting policies disclosed in our 2021 Form 10-K except for the organizational changes and the change in allocation of stockbased compensation expense described above.

In the first nine months of 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel Optane memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment. While Intel Optane is a leading
technology, it was not aligned to our strategic priorities. Separately, we continue to embrace the CXL standard. As a result, we recognized an inventory impairment of $559 million in
Cost of sales on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income in the first nine months of 2022. The impairment charge is recognized as a Corporate charge in the "all other"
category presented above. As we wind down the Intel Optane business, we expect to continue to meet existing customer commitments.

Note 3 : Earnings Per Share
We computed basic earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted
earnings per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during
the period.

Earnings per share—diluted $ 0.25 $ 1.67 $ 2.10 $ 3.73
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.
Securities which would have been anti-dilutive are insignificant and are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented.

In the third quarter of 2022, the 2022 Restructuring Program was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product execution in
alignment with our IDM 2.0 strategy. Restructuring charges are recorded as Corporate charges in the "all other" category presented in Note 2: Operating Segments within Notes to
Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and are primarily comprised of employee severance and benefits arrangements. As of October 1, 2022 we recorded $537 million as a
current liability within Accrued compensation and benefits on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of the first
half of 2023, but they are subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be reflected in our future results of operations.
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in the first nine months of 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and paid in 2009, and a
charge of $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2021 related to the VLSI litigation. These were recorded as a Corporate benefit and charge in the "all other" category presented in "Note
2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Refer to "Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed
Financial Statements for further information on legal proceedings related to the EC fine and the VLSI litigation.
Asset impairment charges includes $237 million of goodwill and other impairments related to the shutdown in the first nine months of 2021 of two of our non-strategic businesses, the
results of which are included in the “all other” category presented in “Note 2: Operating Segments” within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Note 6 : Investments
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. Government debt includes instruments such as
non-U.S. government bonds and U.S. agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as
commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of October 1, 2022 and December 25, 2021, substantially all time deposits were
issued by institutions outside the U.S.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to
economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related
derivative instruments recorded in Interest and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was $16.6 billion as of October 1, 2022 and $21.5 billion as of December 25, 2021.
For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $861 million in the third quarter of 2022 and net losses of $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022
($144 million of net losses in the third quarter of 2021 and $329 million of net losses in the first nine months of 2021). We recorded net gains on the related derivatives of $916 million in
the third quarter of 2022 and net gains of $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022 ($156 million of net gains in the third quarter of 2021 and $346 million of net gains in the first nine
months of 2021).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). The adjusted cost of these investments was $3.6 billion as of October 1, 2022 and $5.0 billion as of December 25, 2021, which approximated the fair value for these periods.
The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of October 1, 2022, was as follows:
(In Millions) Fair Value
Due in 1 year or less $ 11,457
Due in 1–2 years 2,208

McAfee Corp.
McAfee Corp. (McAfee) completed its initial public offering in October 2020. Due to our 41% ownership and significant influence as of December 25, 2021, we accounted for our
investment in McAfee as an equity method investment. We had no accounting carrying value as of December 25, 2021.
In the first nine months of 2022, the sale of McAfee to an investor group was completed and we received $4.6 billion in cash for the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, recognizing a
$4.6 billion gain in Sale of equity investments and other.
Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd.
We account for our interest in Beijing Unisoc Technology Ltd. (Unisoc) as a non-marketable equity security. In the first nine months of 2021, we recognized $471 million of observable

Note 7 : Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
Pending acquisition of Tower Semiconductor
During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash for stock transaction expected to close within twelve
months from the date of the agreement. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy by accelerating our
global end-to-end foundry business. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share of Tower will
be converted into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. This transaction is subject to
certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. If the agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals,
we will be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million.

Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. The NAND memory business includes our NAND
memory fabrication facility in Dalian, China and certain related equipment and tangible assets (the Fab Assets), our NAND SSD business (the NAND SSD Business), and our NAND
memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business). The transaction will be completed in two closings.
The first closing was completed on December 29, 2021. At first closing, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration, with the remaining $2.0 billion to be received by the second closing of
the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025. In connection with the first closing, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within Interest and other, net, and tax expense
of $495 million. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, $583 million of the first closing consideration was deferred and will be
recognized between the first and second closing within Interest and other, net.
At the first closing, we sold to SK hynix the Fab Assets and the NAND SSD Business and transferred certain employees, IP, and other assets related to the NAND OpCo Business to
separately created wholly owned subsidiaries of Intel. The equity interest of the NAND OpCo Business will transfer to SK hynix at the second closing. In connection with the first closing,
we and certain affiliates of SK hynix also entered into a NAND wafer manufacturing and sale agreement, pursuant to which we will manufacture and sell to SK hynix NAND memory
wafers to be manufactured using the Fab Assets in Dalian, China until the second closing. We have concluded based on the terms of the transaction agreements that the subsidiaries
are variable interest entities for which we are not the primary beneficiary, because the governance structure of these entities does not allow us to direct the activities that would most
significantly impact their economic performance. In line with this conclusion, we fully deconsolidated our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business, and recorded a receivable for
the remaining proceeds of $1.9 billion in Other long-term assets, which remains outstanding as of October 1, 2022.
The carrying amounts of the major classes of NAND assets as of the first closing date included the following:
(In Millions) Dec 29, 2021
Inventories $ 941
Property, plant and equipment, net 6,018
Total sold $ 6,959
The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives
and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan
of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our
expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
Our transactions with the NAND OpCo Business between the first and second closings are considered related party transactions due to our equity interests and the wafer manufacturing
and sales agreement. Related party transactions include certain assets that transferred at first closing between Intel and the NAND OpCo Business, or costs that we incurred on behalf
of the NAND OpCo Business, for which we are entitled to be reimbursed. As of October 1, 2022, we have a receivable due to Intel of $346 million recorded within Other current assets
on our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of approximately $35 million per quarter for 2022 for corporate function services, which include human
resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries.

Note 8 : Borrowings
In the third quarter of 2022, we settled in cash $1.0 billion of our senior notes due July 2022 and $400 million of our senior notes due November 2023. In the second quarter of 2022, we
settled in cash $1.6 billion of our senior notes due May 2022.
In the third quarter of 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount.
During the third quarter of 2022, we received proceeds of $140 million in the aggregate for the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler,
Arizona (CIDA). The bonds are our unsecured general obligations in accordance with the loan agreement we entered into with the CIDA. The bonds mature in 2042 and carry an interest
rate of 5.0%. The bonds are subject to mandatory tender in September 2027, at which time we can re-market the bonds as either fixed-rate bonds for a specified period or as variable
rate-bonds until another fixed-rate period is selected or until their final maturity date.
In the first quarter of 2022, we amended our $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the
interest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. The revolving credit facility had no borrowings outstanding as of October 1, 2022.
We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program.
Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain
restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively
rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired
in the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months, and issued debt.
We classify the fair value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these
financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of October 1, 2022 was $569 million (the aggregate carrying value as of

Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships
The before-tax net gains or losses attributed to cash flow hedges recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) were $678 million net losses in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.6
billion net losses in the first nine months of 2022 ($28 million net losses in the third quarter of 2021 and $313 million net losses in the first nine months of 2021). Substantially all of our
cash flow hedges were foreign currency contracts for all periods presented.
During the first nine months of 2022 and 2021, the amounts excluded from effectiveness testing were insignificant.

Note 12 : Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
In the third quarter of 2022, we signed a definitive agreement with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield). This arrangement represents an equity partnership whereby we and
Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively, of what will be a newly-formed entity, Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), which we will fully consolidate into our consolidated financial
statements. We expect Arizona Fab to spend up to $30.0 billion of investments in expanded manufacturing infrastructure at our Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona. Generally,
contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based upon our and Brookfield’s proportional ownership, subject to the terms and conditions within the
definitive agreement. The definitive agreement includes provisions that require us to utilize Arizona Fab’s expanded manufacturing capacity at specified minimum levels or be subject to
penalties. Brookfield’s ownership stake as a non-controlling interest holder in Arizona Fab will be shown as a separate component of equity within our consolidated balance sheet. The
transaction with Brookfield is expected to close by the end of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions.
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to various legal proceedings, including those noted in this section. In the first quarter of 2021, we accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI,
described below. Excluding this charge, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our
financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and
unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct
remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall
trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include
substantial payments. Except as specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.
European Commission Competition Matter
In 2001, the European Commission (EC) commenced an investigation regarding claims by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) that we used unfair business practices to persuade
customers to buy our microprocessors. In May 2009, the EC issued a decision finding that we had violated Article 82 of the EC Treaty and Article 54 of the European Economic Area
Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 (later renumbered as Article 102 by a new treaty) by offering alleged "conditional rebates and payments" that required
our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us. The EC also found that we violated Article 82 by making alleged "payments to prevent sales of specific rival
products." The EC imposed a fine in the amount of €1.1 billion ($1.4 billion as of May 2009), which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009, and ordered us to "immediately
bring to an end the infringement referred to in" the EC decision.
We appealed the EC decision to the Court of First Instance (which has been renamed the General Court) in July 2009. In June 2014, the General Court rejected our appeal in its
entirety. In August 2014, we filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In November 2014, Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed comments in support of
Intel’s grounds of appeal. The Court of Justice issued its decision in September 2017, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and sending the case back to the General Court to
examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition.

Table of Contents
The General Court appointed a panel of five judges to consider our appeal of the EC’s 2009 decision in light of the Court of Justice’s clarifications of the law, and in January 2022, the
General Court issued a decision annulling the EC's findings against Intel regarding rebates as well as the fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to Intel in February 2022. In April
2022, the EC appealed the General Court's decision to the Court of Justice, seeking an order that would require a further proceeding and decision by the General Court. In June 2022,
Intel filed a response in opposition to the EC appeal, and in July 2022, the Intervener Association for Competitive Technologies filed a response in opposition to the EC appeal. Given the
procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter.
In a related matter, Intel filed applications with the General Court in April 2022 seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately €593 million in default interest.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect
many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the
research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. On January 2, 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported,
before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018. As of October 26,
2022, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States, Canada, Israel, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of
purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law
and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in
the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs' failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have
appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of
Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect until November 2022. In Israel, the plaintiff in a lawsuit pending in the District Court of
Haifa advised the court in September 2022 that it intends to seek leave in October 2022 to withdraw its motion for class certification and voluntarily dismiss the action. In Argentina, Intel
Argentina was served with, and responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief.
We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending
proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of
any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of
losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement of eight patents acquired
from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). The patents, which originated at Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. and NXP B.V., are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,268,588; 7,675,806; 7,706,207; 7,709,303;
8,004,922; 8,020,014; 8,268,672; and 8,566,836. VLSI accuses various FPGA and processor products of infringement. VLSI estimated its damages to be at least $5.5 billion, and its
complaint further sought enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs and interest. In May, June, September, and October 2018, Intel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR)
petitions challenging the patentability of claims in all eight of the patents in-suit. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted review of six patents and denied institution on two
patents. As a result of the institution decisions, the parties stipulated to stay the District Court action in March 2019. In December 2019 and February 2020, the PTAB found all claims of
the '588 and '303 patents, and some claims of the '922 patent, to be unpatentable. The PTAB found the challenged claims of the '014, '672, and '207 patents to be patentable. Intel
appealed the PTAB's decision as to '014, '672 and '207 patents. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB's decision as to the '672 and '207 patents, but reversed and remanded as to the
'014 patent. Intel moved for a continuation of the stay in March 2020 pending the appeal. In June 2020, the District Court issued an order continuing the stay through August 2021. The
court lifted the stay in September 2021, and scheduled a trial for March 2024.
In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents acquired
from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos. 6,212,663; 7,246,027; 7,247,552; 7,523,331; and 8,081,026. VLSI accused Intel of willful infringement and seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing
royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and interest. In March 2019, the District Court dismissed VLSI’s claims for willful infringement as to all the patents-in-suit except
the ‘027 patent, and also dismissed VLSI’s allegations of indirect infringement as to the ‘633, ‘331, and ‘026 patents. In June 2019, Intel filed IPR petitions challenging the patentability of
certain claims in all five patents-in-suit. In January 2020, VLSI said that it was no longer asserting any claims of the ‘633 patent. In January and February 2020, the PTAB instituted
review of the '552, '633, '331 and '026 patents, but declined to institute review on the '027 patent. As a result, the District Court stayed the case as to the '026 and '552 patents but
allowed the case to proceed on the '027 and '331 patents. In January 2021, the PTAB invalidated certain asserted claims of the ‘026 patent, and in February the PTAB invalidated all
asserted claims of the ‘552 patent. Both parties filed notices of appeal regarding the PTAB’s decision as to the ‘026 patent in March 2021, and in April 2021, VLSI filed a notice of appeal
of the PTAB's decision as to the '552 patent. The case remains stayed as to both of those patents. For the '027 and '331 patents, VLSI is seeking damages of approximately $4.13 billion
plus enhanced damages for the '027 patent. The parties have completed summary judgment and expert witness testimony briefing.

In June 2022, the court granted in part and denied in part Intel’s motion to exclude testimony of VLSI’s technical expert, barring him from testifying regarding Intel’s purported litigation
misconduct and the alleged benefits of certain claims of the ‘027 patent. In August 2022, the court stayed the case in light of VLSI's failure to fully disclose its investors pursuant to the
court's standing order.
In March 2019, VLSI filed a third suit against Intel, also in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of six more patents acquired from NXP: U.S. Patent Nos.
6,366,522; 6,663,187; 7,292,485; 7,606,983; 7,725,759; and 7,793,025. In April 2019, VLSI voluntarily dismissed this Delaware case without prejudice. In April 2019, VLSI filed three
new infringement suits against Intel in the Western District of Texas (WDTX) accusing various Intel processors of infringement. The three suits collectively assert the same six patents
from the voluntarily dismissed Delaware case plus two additional patents acquired from NXP, U.S. Patent Nos. 7,523,373 and 8,156,357. VLSI accuses Intel of willful infringement and
seeks an injunction or, in the alternative, ongoing royalties, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, and interest. In the first Texas case, VLSI asserted the ‘373 and ‘759 patents
(in December 2020 the court granted Intel summary judgment of non-infringement on the ‘357 patent, which had also been asserted in the first Texas case). That case went to trial in
February 2021, and the jury awarded a “lump sum” to VLSI of $1.5 billion for literal infringement of the ‘373 patent and $675 million for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents of
the ‘759 patent. The jury found that Intel had not willfully infringed either patent. Intel challenged the verdict with post-trial motions, including filing in May 2021 a motion for a new trial,
which the court denied in August, a motion for judgment as a matter of law that the ‘373 and ‘759 patents are not infringed and the ‘759 patent is invalid, and a motion that VLSI is
entitled to no damages, both of which the court denied in March 2022. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment and awarded VLSI $2.175 billion in damages, approximately $162.3
million in pre-judgment interest, and post-judgment interest at the Treasury Bill rate, compounded annually. Intel filed its opening appellate brief in September 2022.
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the ‘522 and ‘187 patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged
infringement of those patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment following second trial in Texas.
The third Texas case was set for trial in April 2022 but was cancelled after the first day due to a COVID-19 outbreak. A new trial date has been set for November 2022. In that case, VLSI
initially sought approximately $2.2 - $2.4 billion for alleged infringement of the ‘983, ‘025 and ‘485 patents, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In April 2022, VLSI informed
the court that it would not present an infringement case at trial for the '025 patent. Later in April 2022, VLSI informed the court that it would not present willful infringement or an
infringement case for the '485 patent at trial. This limits VLSI's damages demand to approximately $1.0 billion for the alleged infringement of the remaining '983 patent.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.
VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201410094015.9 accusing certain Intel Core processors of infringement. VLSI requests an injunction as well as RMB 1 million in damages and RMB 300
thousand in expenses. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the CNIPA, which held a hearing in September 2021. The CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. In
May 2020, defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held the first evidentiary hearing in November 2020 and the
second in July 2021. The court also held trial proceedings in the hearing in July 2021 and concluded that further trial proceedings were needed but indicated those would be stayed
pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. In July 2021, VLSI dismissed its case, but refiled it in August 2021. VLSI seeks an injunction in its newly filed
case, as well as RMB 1.3 million in reasonable costs and expenses, but no damages. In November 2021, Intel moved for a stay of the August 2021 action pending a ruling on invalidity.
The court has not yet ruled on that motion.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a second case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.
VLSI asserts Chinese Patent 201080024173.7. VLSI accuses certain Intel Core processors and seeks an injunction, as well as RMB 1 million in damages and RMB 300 thousand in
expenses. Defendants filed with the CNIPA an invalidation petition in October 2019, and the CNIPA held a hearing in September 2021, but has not yet issued a decision. In June 2020,
defendants filed a motion to stay the trial court proceedings pending a determination on invalidity. The court held its first evidentiary hearing in September 2020. The court held a second
evidentiary hearing in December 2020, and a trial the same month. At trial, VLSI dropped its monetary damages claim, but still requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an
injunction. The court has not yet issued a decision following the trial. Rather, the court stayed the case in December 2020 pending a determination on invalidity by the CNIPA. In March
2022, the CNIPA issued an order holding the claims of the patent to be valid. The court held a second trial in May 2022 following the CNIPA ruling, but has yet to issue its final decision.
In November 2019, Intel, along with Apple Inc., filed a complaint against Fortress Investment Group LLC, Fortress Credit Co. LLC, Uniloc 2017 LLC, Uniloc USA, Inc., Uniloc
Luxembourg S.A.R.L., VLSI, INVT SPE LLC, Inventergy Global, Inc., DSS Technology Management, Inc., IXI IP, LLC, and Seven Networks, LLC. Plaintiffs allege violations of Section 1
of the Sherman Act by certain defendants, Section 7 of the Clayton Act by certain defendants, and California Business and Professions Code section 17200 by all defendants based on
defendants' unlawful aggregation of patents. In 2020 and 2021, the court twice dismissed plaintiffs' complaint with leave to amend. In December 2020, the court granted a joint motion by
Apple and Seven Networks to dismiss with prejudice Apple’s claims against Seven Networks. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in March 2021. Defendants moved to dismiss
the Second Amended Complaint in May 2021. Apple withdrew from the case and dismissed its claims in June 2021. The court heard defendants’ motion to dismiss the Second
Amended Complaint in September 2021, and dismissed Intel’s claims with prejudice that same month, entering judgment in favor of defendants. Intel filed a notice of appeal in
December 2021. Appellate briefing concluded in June 2022 and oral argument was held in October 2022.

In June 2020, affiliates controlled by Fortress Investment Group, which also controls VLSI, acquired Finjan Holdings, Inc. Intel had signed a “Settlement, Release and Patent License
Agreement” with Finjan in 2012, acquiring a license to the patents of Finjan and its affiliates, current or future, through a capture period of November 20, 2022. The agreement also
contains covenants wherein Finjan agrees to cause its affiliates to comply with the agreement. As such, Intel maintains that it now has a license to the patents of VLSI, which has
become a Finjan affiliate, and that Finjan must cause VLSI to dismiss its suits against Intel. In August 2020, Intel started dispute resolution proceedings under the agreement. As a part
of this dispute resolution process, Intel and Finjan held a mediation in December 2020, but failed to resolve their differences. Intel filed suit to enforce its rights under the License
Agreement with Finjan in January 2021 in Delaware Chancery Court. In March 2021, defendants filed motions to dismiss the Chancery Court proceedings. The court heard those
motions in May 2021, and dismissed all of Intel’s claims—except the breach of contract claim—with prejudice in September 2021 for lack of jurisdiction because, the court reasoned,
Intel’s license defense has been raised in the other U.S. suits between Intel and VLSI and could be adjudicated in one of those actions. The court stayed Intel’s breach of contract claim
pending a determination on whether Intel is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In September 2020, Intel filed motions to stay the Texas, Delaware, and Shanghai matters pending resolution of
its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, Intel filed a motion to stay the Shenzhen matter pending resolution of its dispute with Finjan. In November 2020, the Delaware Court denied
Intel’s motion to stay. The other stay motions remain pending. Finally, Intel filed a motion to amend its answer in the Texas matters to add a license defense in November 2020, and filed
a motion to amend its answer in the Delaware matter to add a license defense in February 2021. The Delaware Court granted Intel's motion in July 2021, but in March 2022, the Texas
Court denied Intel's motion, holding, among other things, that it would be futile for Intel to add the license defense as it would not be meritorious. Intel has appealed this ruling as a part
of its appeal of the verdict in the first VLSI Texas trial.
In October and November 2019, and in February 2020, Intel filed IPR petitions on certain asserted claims across six of the patents-in-suit in WDTX. Between May and October 2020, the
PTAB denied all of these petitions on a discretionary basis and without reviewing the merits. Intel requested a rehearing, and review from the POP as to all petitions. All requests for
POP review and rehearing were denied. Intel filed notices of appeal regarding the discretionary denials for all petitions in February and March of 2021. The Federal Circuit dismissed the
appeals in May 2021 for lack of jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit denied Intel’s petition for hearing en banc in August 2021. In March 2022, the Supreme Court denied Intel’s petition for
writ of certiorari.
In June 2021, OpenSky Industries LLC (OpenSky) requested IPR of certain claims of the '373 and '759 patents at-issue in the first Texas case, including those claims found to be
infringed in that judgment. Both petitions copied Intel's earlier petitions, and used the expert declarations previously submitted by Intel. Another entity named Patent Quality Assurance
LLC (PQA) also petitioned for IPR of certain claims of the '373 patent, those claims found to be infringed in the first Texas case judgment. PQA also largely copied Intel's petition, but (1)
added a challenge to an additional claim and (2) included newly signed declarations from Intel's experts. In December 2021, the PTAB instituted OpenSky's petition on the '759 patent,
but declined to institute on the '373 patent. In December 2021, Intel filed a motion to join OpenSky's '759 IPR. In January 2022, the PTAB instituted PQA's petition on the '373 patent. In
February, Intel filed a motion to join PQA's petition. Both of Intel's joinder motions were granted in June 2022, allowing Intel to participate in the IPRs. Hearings were held in September
2022 for the OpenSky petition and in October 2022 for the PQA petition. PTAB decisions are expected in December 2022 on the '759 patent, and January 2023 on the '373 patent. At
the same time, the Director of the United States Patent & Trademark Office is reviewing both the OpenSky and PQA IPRs to determine if they should be allowed to proceed to final
written decisions. The Director has said that that process may delay the final written decision of the '759 patent IPR, but has not made any similar statement regarding the timeline for
the '373 patent IPR.
After consideration of the verdicts in the WDTX cases and the additional pending lawsuits filed by VLSI, Intel accrued a charge of $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2021 and anticipates
losses, if any, in excess of this amount would be immaterial to the financial statements. We dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Starting in July 2020, five securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain current and former
officers based on Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent classes of acquirers of Intel stock between October 2019 and July
2020, generally allege that the defendants violated securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products in light of subsequently announced
delays. In October 2020, the court consolidated the lawsuits, appointed lead plaintiffs, and in January 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Defendants moved to
dismiss the consolidated complaint in March 2021. We dispute the claims described above and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural posture and the nature of
those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or
classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable
estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. In July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is
now Intel 4.

Revenue Summary
Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021
■ Notebook revenue was $4.4 billion, down $1.5 billion from Q3 2021. Notebook unit sales decreased 28% driven by lower demand in the consumer and education market segments.
Notebook ASPs increased 3% due to an increased mix of commercial products and lower mix of consumer and education products.
■ Desktop revenue was $3.2 billion, up $103 million from Q3 2021. Desktop unit sales increased 2% partially due to increased demand for Enthusiast and gaming products, while ASPs
remained flat.
■ Other revenue was $492 million, down $233 million primarily driven by the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business and lower demand for our

Revenue
Segment Revenue Walk $B
Q3 2022 and YTD 2022 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment that continues to deteriorate, with slowing consumer demand, persistent inflation, and
higher interest rates, and that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. We expect the macroeconomic uncertainty and the
challenging market environment will extend into 2023.
Q3 2022 vs. Q3 2021
Our Q3 2022 revenue was $15.3 billion, down $3.9 billion or 20% from Q3 2021. CCG revenue decreased 17% from Q3 2021 due to lower Notebook volume in the consumer and
education market segments, though Notebook ASPs increased due to a resulting change in product mix. CCG also had lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of
our 5G smartphone modem business. DCAI revenue decreased 27% from Q3 2021. Server volume decreased, led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases
to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of revenue from hyperscale customers within a competitive environment.
NEX revenue increased 14% from Q3 2021, primarily due to increased demand for 5G products, higher Ethernet demand and ASPs, and accelerated demand for Edge products,
partially offset by decreased demand for Network Xeon. The decrease in "all other" revenue reflects revenue of $1.1 billion in Q3 2021 related to the divested NAND memory business
for which historical results are recorded in “all other."
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, as
well as increased demand from customers in advance of fourth quarter 2022 price increases, contributed approximately $1.5 billion to our revenue during the third quarter of 2022, the
impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022 as included in our Form 8-K dated October 27, 2022.
YTD 2022 vs. YTD 2021
Our YTD 2022 revenue was $49.0 billion, down $9.5 billion or 16% from YTD 2021. CCG revenue was down 18% from YTD 2021 due to lower Notebook and Desktop volume, and
lower revenue due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem business. Notebook volume decreased driven by lower demand in the consumer and
education market segments, though ASPs increased due to the resulting product mix. Desktop volume decreased driven by lower demand for consumer and education products. DCAI
revenue decreased 8% from YTD 2021 led by enterprise customers, and due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories in a softening datacenter market. Server
ASPs decreased due to customer and product mix. NEX revenue increased 16%, driven by increased demand for Ethernet and 5G products, accelerated demand for Edge products,
and higher ASPs, partially offset by lower demand for Network Xeon. Mobileye revenue increased 27% from YTD 2021 primarily driven by higher demand for EyeQ products. The
decrease in our "all other" revenue is due to revenue from the divested NAND memory business of $3.3 billion recognized in YTD 2021 for which historical results are recorded in “all
other”, and $584 million of revenue recognized in YTD 2021 from a prepaid customer supply customer.
Historically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quarter. In
2021, continued strong COVID-driven Notebook demand in the first half of the year contributed to a flatter trend than we historically observe. For the remainder of 2022, we continue to
expect a flatter trend than we historically observed as we experience the uncertainty and impacts, including on demand and the supply chain, of current macroeconomic conditions, the
potential for a recession, and the risk for continued COVID-related disruptions or shutdowns.

Form 10-K, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires increased investments in R&D, and an intensified effort to attract
and retain talent. We expect to complete the year with total R&D and MG&A expenses roughly flat in the second half of 2022 relative to the first half of 2022, as we continue to
implement certain cost-cutting measures, including slowing the pace of hiring, while at the same time continuing to improve our product execution in response to the continued decline in

In Q3 2022, the 2022 Restructuring Program was approved to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product execution in alignment with our
IDM 2.0 strategy. We expect that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain of these cost savings in
resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our IDM 2.0 strategy.
Employee severance and benefit arrangements includes charges incurred to date under the 2022 Restructuring Program of $607 million, which was approved in Q3 2022 and expected
to be substantially completed by the end of the first half of 2023, but is subject to change.
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in YTD 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded and paid in 2009, and a charge of $2.2 billion in

In Q3 2022 we recognized a benefit from taxes as we applied our estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income. In YTD 2022, we recognized a
benefit from taxes as compared to a provision for taxes in YTD 2021 due to lower income before taxes, a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and a
change in tax law from 2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D expenses that went into effect in January 2022. These YTD 2022 impacts were partially offset by the
unfavorable tax rate effects associated with the gains recognized in YTD 2022 from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of our NAND memory business. In Q3 2021 and YTD
2021, we recognized one-time tax benefits from the restructuring of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries.

See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD&A.
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, supplemented by our
total cash and investments , as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements
include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential
and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding
requirements incrementally contemplate additional investments in the significant manufacturing expansion plans we announced as part of our IDM 2.0 strategy and additional
investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts
or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and
conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and beginning in Q3 2022,
selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments.
Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements.
In the third quarter of 2022, we issued a total of $6.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, including our inaugural green bond issuance of $1.3 billion principal amount. We
are using the proceeds from the green bond offering to fund projects that support our investments in sustainable operations. We intend to use the proceeds from the remainder of the
offering for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also received proceeds
of $140 million in the aggregate from the sale of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (CIDA). In the first quarter of 2022 we amended
our $5.0 billion variable-rate revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2027 and transitioning the interest terms from LIBOR to term SOFR. Other
potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified
amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of
October 1, 2022, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facility.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing
receivables are in investment-grade securities.

Net cash used for financing activities (982) (2,505)
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (298) $ 2,005
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
The decrease in cash provided by operations in YTD 2022 was primarily driven by lower net income after adjusting for non-cash items, including the gain on the sale of McAfee and the
pre-tax gain from the divestiture of our NAND business; and was also affected by cash-unfavorable working capital changes.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; cash used for acquisitions; and proceeds from divestitures.
Cash used for investing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to increased maturities and sales of short-term investments, proceeds from the
divestiture of our NAND business, and proceeds from the sale of our remaining share of McAfee, partially offset by higher capital expenditures.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock through employee equity incentive plans, and repurchases of common stock.
Cash used for financing activities was lower in YTD 2022 compared to YTD 2021, primarily due to our curtailment of common stock repurchases and higher debt issuance, offset by
higher debt repayments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP
financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where
certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and
measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects where applicable. Income tax effects have
been calculated using an appropriate tax rate for each adjustment, as applicable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial
measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
Non-GAAP adjustment or
measure Definition Usefulness to management and investors
NAND memory business We completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory
business to SK hynix on December 29, 2021 and fully deconsolidated our
ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022.
We exclude the impact of our NAND memory business in certain nonGAAP measures. While the second closing of the sale is still pending and
subject to closing conditions, we deconsolidated this business in Q1 2022
and management does not view the historical results of the business as a
part of our core operations. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core
business model and how management currently evaluates core
operational performance. In making these adjustments, we have not made
any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or
other financial statement amounts.
Acquisition-related adjustments Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of
amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands,
and customer relationships acquired in connection with business
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are
recorded within both cost of sales and MG&A in our US GAAP financial
statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful
life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally
recorded over multiple years.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible
assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because
these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by
the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a
useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to
our past operating performance and provide investors with additional
means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Restructuring and other charges Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring
plan and are primarily related to employee severance and benefit
arrangements. Other charges include periodic goodwill and asset
impairments, pension charges, and costs associated with restructuring
activity.
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including any adjustments to
charges recorded in prior periods, for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our core operating
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our core
operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and
provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.
Share-based compensation Share-based compensation consists of charges related to our employee
equity incentive plans.
We exclude charges related to share-based compensation for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because we believe these
adjustments provide better comparability to peer company results and
because these charges are not viewed by management as part of our
core operating performance. We believe these adjustments provide
investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of our core
business model, how management currently evaluates core operational
performance, and additional means to evaluate expense trends, including
in comparison to other peer companies.

Non-GAAP adjustment or
measure Definition Usefulness to management and investors
Gains (losses) from divestiture Gains or losses are recognized at the close of a divestiture, or over a
specified deferral period when deferred consideration is received at the
time of closing. Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in connection with the
first closing of the sale of our NAND memory business on December 29,
2021, a portion of the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be
recognized between first and second closing.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures for purposes of
calculating certain non-GAAP measures because they do not reflect our
current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful
evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past
operating results.
(Gains) losses on equity
investments, net
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of ongoing mark-tomarket adjustments on marketable equity securities, observable price
adjustments on non-marketable equity securities, related impairment
charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.
We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for better comparability
between periods. The exclusion reflects how management evaluates the
core operations of the business.
Tax Reform Adjustments for Tax Reform reflect the impact of a change in tax law from
2017 Tax Reform related to the capitalization of R&D costs.
We exclude the impacts of this 2022 change in U.S. tax treatment of R&D
costs for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures as we
believe these adjustments facilitate a better evaluation of our current
operating performance and comparison to past operating results.
Adjusted free cash flow We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of adjusted free cash flow,
which is used by management when assessing our sources of liquidity,
capital resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash flow is
operating cash flow adjusted for 1) additions to property, plant and
equipment, net of proceeds from capital grants, 2) payments on finance
leases, and 3) proceeds from the McAfee equity sale.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in understanding our capital
requirements and sources of liquidity by providing an additional means to
evaluate the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 divestiture,
McAfee equity distributions and sales have contributed to operating and
free cash flow, and while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would
typically be excluded from adjusted free cash flow as an equity sale, we
believe including the sale proceeds in adjusted free cash flow facilitate a
better, more consistent comparison to past presentations of liquidity.
Total cash and investments Total cash and investments is used by management when assessing our
sources of liquidity, which includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term
investments, and loans receivable and other.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our capital resources
and liquidity position.

Other Key Information
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not
entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and
commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2021 Form 10-K.
Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2021 Form 10-K and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 2, 2022 (Q1 2022 Form 10-Q) could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. The Risk Factors section in our 2021 Form 10-
K, as updated by our Q1 2022 Form 10-Q, remains current in all material respects. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by
factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results
may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth
in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial
reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to
their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not
occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended
October 1, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or
negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending October 1, 2022. As of October 1, 2022, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which
$7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our
employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon
vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or
dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific U.S. economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in
compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such
sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct business within the Russian
Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no
gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all business operations in Russia until
further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by applicable law.
On April 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the
sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security
vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any
such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Exhibit 10.3
INTEL CORPORATION
2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
1. Terms of Restricted Stock Unit. This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, including any appendix attached hereto (this Restricted
Stock Unit Agreement and such appendix, together, this “Agreement”), the Restricted Stock Unit Notice of Grant delivered online by logging into
the E*TRADE Financial Corporation website (the “Notice of Grant”) and the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), as
such may be amended from time to time, constitute the entire understanding between you and Intel Corporation (the “Corporation”) regarding the
Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) identified in your Notice of Grant. The RSUs granted to you are effective as of the grant date set forth in the
Notice of Grant (the “Grant Date”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Agreement and the 2006 Plan, the terms of the 2006 Plan
will control. Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement or in the Notice of Grant but defined in the 2006 Plan will have the same
definitions as in the 2006 Plan.
2. Vesting of RSUs. Provided that you continuously serve as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors from the Grant Date
specified in the Notice of Grant up to and onto each vesting date specified in the Notice of Grant, the RSUs shall vest and be converted into the
right to receive the number of shares of the Corporation’s Common Stock, $.001 par value (the “Common Stock”), specified in the Notice of
Grant with respect to such vesting date, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If a vesting date falls on a weekend or any other day on
which the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) is not open, affected RSUs will vest on the next following Nasdaq business day.
RSUs will vest to the extent provided in and in accordance with the terms of the Notice of Grant and this Agreement. If your status as a
member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors terminates for any reason except death, Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined
below), prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, your unvested RSUs will be cancelled.
3. Conversion into Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock will be issued or become free of restrictions as soon as practicable
following the vesting of the RSUs, provided that you have satisfied your tax withholding obligations as specified under Section 8 of this
Agreement and you have completed, signed and returned any documents and taken any additional action that the Corporation deems appropriate to
enable it to accomplish the delivery of the shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock will be issued in your name (or may be issued
to your executor or personal representative, in the event of your death or Disablement), and may be effected by recording shares on the stock
records of the Corporation or by crediting shares in an account established on your behalf with a brokerage firm or other custodian, in each case as
determined by the Corporation. In no event will the Corporation be obligated to issue a fractional share.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Corporation will not be obligated to deliver any shares of the Common Stock during any period
when the Corporation determines that the conversion of a RSU or the delivery of shares hereunder would violate any laws of the United States or
your country of residence and/or may issue shares subject to any restrictive legends that, as determined by the Corporation’s counsel, is necessary
to comply with securities or other regulatory
-1-

requirements, and (ii) the date on which shares are issued or credited to your account may include a delay in order to provide the Corporation such
time as it determines appropriate to address tax withholding and to address other administrative matters. The number of shares of Common Stock
into which RSUs convert as specified in the Notice of Grant shall be adjusted for stock splits and similar matters as specified in and pursuant to
the 2006 Plan.
4. Termination of Service as Director. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if your term of service as a director
of the Corporation’s Board of Directors terminates for any reason, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, other than on account of death,
Disablement (defined below) or Retirement (defined below), all RSUs not then vested shall be cancelled on the date of termination of service.
5. Death. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, if you die during your term of service as a member of the
Corporation’s Board of Directors, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested.
6. Disablement. Except as expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%)
vested, if your service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors terminates due to your Disablement.
For purposes of this Section 6, “Disablement” will be determined in accordance with the standards and procedures of the then-current
Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the Corporation and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan
maintained by the Corporation, and in the event you are not a participant in a then-current Long Term Disability Plan maintained by the
Corporation, “Disablement” will have the same meaning as disablement is defined in the Intel Long Term Disability Plan, which is generally a
physical condition arising from an illness or injury, which renders you incapable of performing work in your regular occupation, as determined by
the Corporation. Your regular occupation is the occupation you routinely perform at the time your Disablement began.
7. Retirement. If you retire from service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors at age 75 or more, or with at least seven
(7) years of service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors, your RSUs will become one hundred percent (100%) vested.
8. Tax Withholding. RSUs are taxable upon vesting (as indicated in your Notice of Grant) or, if later, the date to which you have
deferred settlement of your RSUs. To the extent required by applicable federal, state or other law, you will make arrangements satisfactory to the
Corporation for the payment and satisfaction of any income tax, social security tax, payroll tax, social taxes, applicable national or local taxes, or
payment on account of other tax related to withholding obligations that arise by reason of granting or vesting of RSUs or sale of Common Stock
shares from vested RSUs (whichever is applicable).
The Corporation will not be required to issue or lift any restrictions on shares of the Common Stock pursuant to your RSUs or to recognize
any purported transfer of shares of the Common Stock until such obligations are satisfied.
Unless provided otherwise by the Committee, these obligations will be satisfied by the Corporation withholding a number of shares of
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued under the RSUs that the Corporation determines has a Market Value sufficient to meet the tax
withholding obligations. In the event that the Committee provides that these obligations will not be satisfied under the method described in the
previous sentence, you authorize E*TRADE Financial Corporate Services, Inc. and E*TRADE Securities LLC (“E*Trade”), or any successor
plan administrator, to sell a number of shares of Common Stock that are issued under the RSUs, which the Corporation determines is sufficient to
generate an amount that meets the tax withholding obligations plus additional shares to account for rounding and market fluctuations, and to pay
such
-2-

tax withholding to the Corporation for remittance to the appropriate tax authorities. The shares may be sold as part of a block trade with other
participants of the 2006 Plan in which all participants receive an average price. For this purpose, "Market Value" will be calculated as the average
of the highest and lowest sales prices of the Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq on the day your RSUs vest. The future value of the underlying
shares of Common Stock is unknown and cannot be predicted with certainty.
You are ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed by you in connection with your RSUs, regardless of any action the Corporation
takes or any transaction pursuant to this Section with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the RSUs. The
Corporation makes no representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the grant, issuance, vesting
or settlement of the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any of the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs that vest. The Corporation does not
commit and is under no obligation to structure the RSU program to reduce or eliminate your tax liability.
9. Election to Defer Receipt of RSU Shares. You may elect to defer receipt of shares of Common Stock relating to an RSU beyond the
vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant under the rules and procedures established separately by the Corporation. That election will allow
you to defer income recognition, until the date on which your service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors terminates for any
reason. Under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the election to defer under this section must be made in the calendar year prior to the year in
which services related to those RSU’s are first performed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shares of Common Stock
will not be issued and you will not have any rights of a stockholder in Common Stock issuable under this Agreement to the extent that you have
elected to defer the issuance and receipt of such Common Stock. If, however, your service as a member of the Corporation’s Board of Directors
terminates prior to the vesting dates set forth in your Notice of Grant, any shares that would not have vested on your date of termination will be
cancelled regardless of your election. Notwithstanding your election to defer made in the calendar year prior to grant, the Corporation is not
obligated to make a grant in any future year or in any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation might make a grant
in any future year or in any given amount.
10. Rights as Stockholder. Your RSUs may not be otherwise transferred or assigned, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in
any way, whether by operation of law or otherwise, and may not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempt to transfer,
assign, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of your RSUs other than as permitted above, will be void and unenforceable against the Corporation.
You will have the rights of a stockholder only after shares of the Common Stock have been issued to you following vesting of your RSUs
and satisfaction of all other conditions to the issuance of those shares as set forth in this Agreement. RSUs shall not entitle you to any rights of a
stockholder of Common Stock and there are no voting or dividend rights with respect to your RSUs. RSUs shall remain terminable pursuant to
this Agreement at all times until they vest and convert into shares.
11. Amendments. The 2006 Plan and RSUs may be amended or altered by the Committee or the Board of Directors of the Corporation
to the extent provided in the 2006 Plan.
12. Data Privacy. You explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your
personal data as described in this document and any other RSU grant materials (“Data”) by and among, the Corporation and any other
Subsidiary for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan.
-3-

You hereby understand that the Corporation holds certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name,
home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any
shares of stock or directorships held in the Corporation, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled,
exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor for the purpose of implementing, administering and managing the 2006 Plan. You
hereby understand that Data will be transferred E*Trade and any other third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and
management of the 2006 Plan, that these recipients may be located in your country or elsewhere, and that the recipient’s country (e.g., the
United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country. You hereby understand that you may request a list with
the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative. You authorize the
Corporation, E*Trade and any other possible recipients to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for
the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the 2006 Plan, including any requisite transfer of
such Data as may be required to another broker or other third party with whom you may elect to deposit any shares of Common Stock
acquired under your RSUs. You hereby understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage
your participation in the 2006 Plan. You hereby understand that you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the
storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without
cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative.
Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis. If you do not consent, or if you later
seek to revoke your consent, your service with the Company will not be affected; the only consequence of refusing or withdrawing your
consent is that the Corporation would not be able to grant you RSUs or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore,
you hereby understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the 2006 Plan. For more
information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you hereby understand that you may contact the human
resources representative responsible for your country at the local or regional level.
Finally, upon request of the Corporation, you agree to provide an executed data privacy consent form (or any other agreements or
consents) that the Corporation may deem necessary to obtain from you for the purpose of administering your participation in the 2006 Plan in
compliance with the data privacy laws in your country, either now or in the future. You understand and agree that you will not be able to
participate in the 2006 Plan if you fail to provide any such consent or agreement requested by the Corporation.
13. The 2006 Plan and Other Terms; Other Matters.
(a) Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the 2006 Plan. Any prior agreements, commitments or
negotiations concerning the RSUs are superseded by this Agreement and your Notice of Grant. You hereby acknowledge that a copy of the 2006
Plan has been made available to you.
The grant of RSUs to you in any one year, or at any time, does not obligate the Corporation to make a grant in any future year or in
any given amount and should not create an expectation that the Corporation might make a grant in any future year or in any given amount.
(b) To the extent that the grant of RSUs refers to the Common Stock of Intel Corporation, and as required by the laws of your
country of residence, only authorized but unissued shares thereof will be utilized for delivery upon vesting in accord with the terms hereof.
-4-

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any changes in law or the financial or tax accounting rules
applicable to the RSUs covered by this Agreement will occur, the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, (1) modify this Agreement to impose
such restrictions or procedures with respect to the RSUs (whether vested or unvested), the shares issued or issuable pursuant to the RSUs and/or
any proceeds or payments from or relating to such shares as it determines to be necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or to
address, comply with or offset the economic effect to the Corporation of any accounting or administrative matters relating thereto, or (2) cancel
and cause a forfeiture with respect to any unvested RSUs at the time of such determination.
(d) Because this Agreement relates to terms and conditions under which you may be issued shares of Common Stock of Intel
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, an essential term of this Agreement is that it will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to choice of law principles of Delaware or other jurisdictions. Any action, suit, or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the RSUs
granted hereunder will be brought in the state or federal courts of competent jurisdiction in the State of California.
(e) Each payment under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code (“Code”). The RSUs are intended to comply with or be exempt from the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code and
shall be limited, construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent; provided, that the Corporation does not guarantee you any particular tax
treatment of the RSUs. In addition, if any provision of the RSUs would cause you to incur any penalty tax or interest under Section 409A of the
Code or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Corporation may reform such provision to maintain to the maximum
extent practicable the original intent of the applicable provision without violating the provisions of Section 409A of the Code. In no event
whatsoever shall the Corporation be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalties that may be imposed on you by Section 409A of the Code or
any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code.
(f) Copies of Intel Corporation's Annual Report to Stockholders for its latest fiscal year and Intel Corporation's latest quarterly
report are available, without charge, at the Corporation's business office.
14. Appendix. The RSUs and the shares of Common Stock acquired under the 2006 Plan shall be subject to any special terms and
conditions for your country set forth in the Appendix to this Agreement. The Appendix constitutes part of this Agreement.

Appendix to the
INTEL CORPORATION 
2006 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Appendix will have the meaning given to them in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the
“Agreement”) and/or the Intel Corporation 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”), as applicable.
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix, which is part of the Agreement, contains additional or different terms and conditions that govern the RSUs if you are residing
outside of the United States. The terms and conditions in Part A apply to all participants outside of the United States. The country-specific terms
and conditions in Part B apply to participants located in any of the countries listed in Part B.
If you are a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which you are currently residing and/or working, transfer residency to another
country after the RSUs are granted to you or are considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the Corporation will determine to
what extent the terms and conditions herein will apply to you.
Notifications
This Appendix also includes information regarding securities laws and certain other issues of which you should be aware with respect to your
participation in the 2006 Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in the respective countries as
of January 2021. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Corporation strongly recommends that you not rely on the
information noted herein as the only source of information relating to the consequences of your participation in the 2006 Plan because the
information may be out of date at vesting and settlement of the RSUs, upon the subsequent sale of the shares of Common Stock or upon the
receipt of any dividends.
In addition, the information is general in nature and may not apply to your particular situation, and the Corporation is not in a position to assure
you of any particular result. Accordingly, you should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in your country may apply
to your situation.
1. NON-U.S. PROVISIONS
a. Nature of Grant. The following provision supplements Section 13 of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement. In accepting the RSUs,
you acknowledge, understand and agree that:
(i)the 2006 Plan is established voluntarily by the Corporation, is discretionary in nature and may be modified, amended, suspended or
terminated by the Corporation at any time, to the extent permitted by the 2006 Plan;
(ii)the grant of the RSUs is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of restricted
stock units, or benefits in lieu of restricted stock units, even if restricted stock units have been granted in the past;
(iii)all decisions with respect to future restricted stock units or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Corporation;
-6-

(iv)the grant of RSUs and your participation in the 2006 Plan shall not create a right to employment or service or be interpreted as forming an
employment or service contract with the Corporation and shall not interfere with the ability of the Corporation, to terminate your service;
(v)you are voluntarily participating in the 2006 Plan;
(vi)the RSUs and the shares of Common Stock subject to the RSUs, and the income from and value of same, are not intended to replace any
pension rights or compensation;
(vii)the RSUs and the shares of Common Stock subject to the RSUs, and the income from and value of same, are not part of normal or
expected compensation for any purposes, including, but not limited to, calculation of any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy,
dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar mandatory payments;
(viii)the future value of the underlying shares of Common Stock is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;
(ix)notwithstanding any terms or conditions of the 2006 Plan to the contrary, for purposes of your RSUs, your service will be considered
terminated as of the date you are no longer actively providing services to the Corporation (regardless of the reason for such termination and
whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of service laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing service or the terms of your service
agreement, if any) and will not be extended by any notice period (e.g., your period of service would not include any contractual notice period or
any period of “garden leave” or similar period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing service or the terms
of your service agreement, if any). The Committee (as defined below) shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer
actively providing services for purposes of your RSU grant (including whether you may still be considered to be providing services while on a
leave of absence); and
(x)the Corporation will not be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that
may affect the value of the RSUs or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the RSUs or the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock
subject to the RSUs acquired under the 2006 Plan.
b. Language. You acknowledge that you are proficient in the English language, or have consulted with an advisor who is sufficiently
proficient in English, so as to allow you to understand the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you have received this Agreement or any
other document related to the RSUs translated into a language other than English and if the meaning of the translated version differs from the
English version, the English version shall control.
c. Electronic Delivery and Participation. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to RSUs
granted under the 2006 Plan or future RSUs that may be granted under the 2006 Plan by electronic means or request your consent to participate in
the 2006 Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the 2006 Plan
through any on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Corporation or a third party designated by the Corporation.
d. Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws. You acknowledge that you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or
market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable jurisdictions, including the United
States, your country and the broker’s country, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common
Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., RSUs) or rights links to the value of shares of Common Stock under the 2006 Plan during such
times as you considered to have “inside information” regarding the Corporation (as defined by the laws in the
-7-

applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you
possessed inside information. Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be
imposed under any applicable Corporation insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable
restrictions and that you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
e. Exchange Control, Foreign Asset/Account and/or Tax Reporting Requirements. You acknowledge that there may be certain
exchange control, foreign asset/account and/or tax reporting requirements which may affect your ability to acquire or hold shares of Common
Stock or cash received from participating in the 2006 Plan (including the proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock and the receipt of any
dividends) in a brokerage or bank account outside your country. You may be required to report such accounts, assets or related transactions to the
tax or other authorities in your country. You also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of participating in
the 2006 Plan to your country within a certain time after receipt. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with such regulations
and that you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
