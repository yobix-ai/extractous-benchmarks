Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 30, 2022 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, as filed with the SEC,
but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the
interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 30, 2022.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 30, 2022.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are both 52-week years. The third
quarters of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Prior period intangible asset gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization in Note 9 have been adjusted to write off immaterial fully
amortized intangible assets as of January 30, 2022.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Note 2 - Business Combination
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby
NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges
preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023
reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing.

Note 6 – Income Taxes
We recognized an income tax benefit of $67 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively,
and an income tax expense of $174 million and $327 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. Income
tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
respectively, and an expense of 6.6% and 4.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023 as compared to the same periods of fiscal
year 2022 was primarily due to the increased tax benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, and the
U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to a lower expected profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of
earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time discrete benefit from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets in connection with
the domestication of one of our foreign subsidiaries, or the Domestication, in fiscal year 2022.
Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from
the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.
Our effective tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax benefits from
the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax
rate, the discrete benefit of the Domestication, and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit.
For the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax
jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Additionally, there have
been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022.

While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not

Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are
made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 30, 2022, we do not believe

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 30, 2022 and January 30, 2022:

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint
on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to
channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also
alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class
certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert
fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the
complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from
judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. Oral argument on the appeal was held on May 10,
2022.

plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,

waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false

Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of October 30, 2022, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based
on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in
these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of
business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged
across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of
making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related
and other costs, corporate infrastructure and support costs, restructuring costs, acquisition termination cost, IP-related and legal settlement
costs, contributions, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense
directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate
depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics,
we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D
graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data
science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply
Because we do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products, we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and assemble our
products. Our manufacturing lead times are very long, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. At the same time, we
do not have a guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a
quarter or year, which has previously caused changes to expected revenue and cash flows, and which may reoccur in the future. If our estimates
of customer
24

demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between
supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and
significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor
industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we have experienced in the past, the lead time on our orders for certain supply
has extended to more than twelve months, compared to a historical lead time of approximately six months. Extended lead times may continue if
we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. As a result, we have paid premiums and provided deposits
to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs, and may need to continue to do so in the future. We may not have
the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Our supply, which includes inventory on hand,
purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions and complexity of our
products. Purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represent approximately three quarters of our total supply.
Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product
releases and announcements, competing technologies, and changes in macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and fluctuating
interest rates. Each of these factors has previously impacted, and can in the future impact, the timing and volume of our revenue. Our demand
predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our
revenue as we manage shipments of legacy prior architecture products and channel partners prepare and adjust to support new products. We
have recently begun transitioning architectures for both our Gaming and Data Center products, which may impair our ability to predict demand
and impact our supply mix. We may experience, and have in the past experienced, reduced demand for current generation architectures when
customers anticipate transitions. Although we have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, this trend may not continue
for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial
results may be negatively impacted. Our ability to sell certain products has in the past been and can in the future be impeded if components from
third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. Additionally, we sell most of our products through channel partners,
who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in
response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to
impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.
COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create supply and logistics constraints. The war in
Ukraine has further strained global supply chains and may in the future result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our
foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs.
Our products are designed for the Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive markets. The use of our GPUs for use cases
other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact
demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, many years ago, our Gaming GPUs
began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any
reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on
demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies,
government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain
transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to
estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented
Ethereum 2.0 merge may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which
could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR,
GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct
miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new
products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult.
Gray market products or reseller marketplaces compete with our distribution channels.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions,
impact exports to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which
incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The
25

new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance
equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. We are
also required to obtain a license to export a wide array of products, including networking products destined for certain end users and any system
in China that can achieve single precision performance of 200 Petaops, or double precision performance of 100 Petaops, within a 41,600 cubic
feet envelope.
We will be required to transition certain operations out of China, which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research
and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period.
We have engaged with customers in China to satisfy their demand with products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new
A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer
but have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner.
The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell
products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative
product offerings, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, or if the USG does not grant licenses in
a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or
impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the
licensing process will make our sales and support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue
alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
COVID-19
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we reopened our offices worldwide. We have and expect to incur incremental expenses and related
in-office costs as we resume onsite services.
Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment
efforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted and this impact may continue if future and
continued lockdowns occur. These ongoing COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create
supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global
and regional basis.
Russia
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we paused direct sales to Russia. Direct sales to Russia in fiscal year 2022 were immaterial. Our
revenue to partners that sell into Russia may be negatively impacted due to the war in Ukraine and we estimate that in fiscal year 2022, Russia
accounted for approximately 2% of total end customer sales and 4% of Gaming end customer sales. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,
we closed business operations in Russia.
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired
Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction.
We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment
provided at signing.

We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate
processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where
our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive.
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 was $5.93 billion, down 17% from a year ago and down 12% sequentially.
Data Center revenue was up 31% from a year ago and up 1% sequentially. Year-on-year growth was broad-based across U.S. cloud service
providers, consumer internet companies and other vertical industries. Sequential growth was impacted by softness in China. We started shipping
our flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper-architecture.
During the third quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions on exports of our A100 and H100-based products to China, and any
product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third-quarter revenue, with the decline largely offset by
sales of alternative products into China.
Gaming revenue was down 51% from a year ago and down 23% sequentially, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory
levels with current demand expectations as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continue to weigh on consumer demand.
The year-on-year decrease was driven by lower GPU sales for both desktops and laptops; the sequential decline was primarily driven by lower
GPU sales for laptops. We believe the recent transition in verifying Ethereum cryptocurrency transactions from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake
has reduced the utility of GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. This may have contributed to increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs in certain
markets, potentially impacting demand for some of our products, particularly in the low-end.
Professional Visualization revenue was down 65% from a year ago and down 60% sequentially, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align
channel inventory levels with current demand expectations.
Automotive revenue was up 86% from a year ago and up 14% sequentially, primarily driven by revenue from self-driving solutions.
OEM and Other revenue was down 69% from a year ago and down 48% sequentially. The sequential decline was driven by lower Jetson and
notebook OEM sales. Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) revenue was nominal in the current and prior quarter, and $105 million in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2022.
Gross margin for the third quarter was down 11.6% from a year earlier, primarily due to a $702 million inventory charge, largely relating to lower
Data Center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty-related benefit of approximately $70 million. Sequentially, gross margin was up
10.1% primarily due to lower inventory charges compared with the second quarter. The $702 million inventory charge consists of approximately
$354 million for inventory on hand and approximately $348 million for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand
projections.
Operating expenses increased primarily due to compensation and data center infrastructure. The year-on-year increase also reflects employee
growth.
27

Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $13.14 billion, down from $19.30 billion a year ago and down from $17.04 billion a
quarter ago. The year-on-year and sequential decreases reflect share repurchases and changes in operating cash flow.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we returned $3.75 billion and $9.29 billion to shareholders in the form of share
repurchases and cash dividends, respectively. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we had $8.28 billion remaining under our
share repurchase authorization through December 2023.

Compute & Networking - The year-on-year growth was broad-based across U.S. cloud service providers, consumer internet companies and
other vertical industries. We started shipping our flagship H100 data center GPU based on the new Hopper-architecture. CMP contributed an
insignificant amount in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to $105 million in the third quarter and $526 million in
the first nine months of fiscal year 2022.
Graphics - The year-on-year decreases primarily reflect lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand
expectations as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continue to weigh on consumer demand.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 64% and 71% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2023, respectively, and 84% and 85% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022,
respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to countries based on the billed location even if the revenue may be attributable to end
customers in a different location.
29

One customer represented 10% of our total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and was attributable primarily to the Compute &
Networking segment. No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 and for the third quarter
and first nine months of fiscal year 2022.
Gross Margin
Our overall gross margin decreased to 53.6% and 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively, from 65.2%
and 64.7% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to $702 million and
$2.01 billion of inventory provisions in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. The third quarter of fiscal year
2023 included a warranty-related benefit of approximately $70 million. The $702 million inventory provision consists of approximately $354
million for inventory on hand and approximately $348 million for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections. The
$2.01 billion inventory provision in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 consists of approximately $942 million for inventory on hand and
approximately $1.07 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of our current demand projections.
Inventory provisions totaled $702 million and $107 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory that
was previously written-off or down totaled $21 million and $48 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result,
the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.5% and 0.8% in the third quarter of fiscal years 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
Inventory provisions totaled $2.01 billion and $238 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales of inventory
that was previously written-off or down totaled $59 million and $89 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. As
a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 9.3% and 0.8% in the first nine months of fiscal years 2023 and
2022, respectively.
Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment decreased during the third quarter and first nine months of
fiscal year 2023 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, primarily due to inventory provisions.
Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment decreased during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 compared to the third quarter of
fiscal year 2022 primarily due to a lower-end mix within GeForce GPUs. The decrease in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to
the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 was primarily related to inventory and related provisions and pricing programs.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was primarily
due to higher interest rates earned on our investments.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes. The increase in expense for the
first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022 reflects interest on the $5.00 billion note issued in June
2021.
Other, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in

of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our investments in non-affiliated entities.
Income Taxes
We recognized an income tax benefit of $67 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively,
and an income tax expense of $174 million and $327 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively. Income
tax as a percentage of income before income tax was a benefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
respectively, and an expense of 6.6% and 4.6% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2022, respectively.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023 as compared to the same periods of fiscal
year 2022 was primarily due to the increased tax benefit of the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation, and the
U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to a lower expected profitability. This is partially offset by the impact of an increase in the proportion of
earnings subject to U.S. tax in fiscal year 2023 and the one-time discrete benefit from re-valuing certain deferred tax assets in connection with
the Domestication in fiscal year 2022.

Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,393 $ 6,075
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ 7,378 $ (8,244)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (9,961) $ 2,610
As of October 30, 2022, we had $13.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, a decrease of $8.07 billion from the end of
fiscal year 2022. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and
credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022,
primarily due to tax payments, and a decrease in net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the Arm acquisition termination cost of
$1.35 billion, partially offset by changes in working capital.
Cash provided by investing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to cash used in the first nine months of
fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by higher marketable securities sales and maturities, lower purchases of marketable securities, offset by higher
capital expenditures.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2022,
which primarily reflects share repurchases and the absence of debt issuance proceeds in the first nine months of fiscal year 2023.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
October 30, 2022, we had $13.14 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt
securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities,
as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S.
dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have
sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our future
supply obligations and debt due in fiscal year 2024. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to
external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.
For fiscal year 2023, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our
operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.80 billion to $2.00 billion related to property and equipment.
We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued
any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of October 30, 2022 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal
income taxes. We utilized nearly all our accumulated U.S. federal research tax credits during fiscal year 2022, which has resulted in higher cash
tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2023, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requires taxpayers to
capitalize research and development expenditures and to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen
years. This will impact cash flows from operations and will result in significantly higher cash tax payments starting in fiscal year 2023.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we returned $3.65 billion and $8.99 billion, respectively, in share repurchases
and $100 million and $300 million, respectively, in cash dividends. From October 31, 2022 through November 17, 2022, we repurchased
7 million shares for $1.05 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our
Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends are in the best interests of our shareholders.

We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of October 30, 2022, we had not issued any
commercial paper.
Contractual Obligations
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $869 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $80 million recorded in non-current income
tax payable as of October 30, 2022. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties
in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We
are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Other than the contractual obligations described above, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our
contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022. Refer to Item 7,
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 for a description of our contractual obligations. For a description of our
operating lease obligations, long-term debt, and purchase obligations, refer to Note 3, Note 12, and Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively.
Climate Change
To date, there has been no material impact to our results of operations associated with global sustainability regulations, compliance, costs from
sourcing renewable energy or climate-related business trends.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
There has been no adoption of any new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of October 30, 2022, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)
were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial
records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, we completed the
consolidated financial reporting phase of the implementation, which included updating our internal control over financial reporting. We will
continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our
legal proceedings since January 30, 2022. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 30, 2022 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarters ended May 1, 2022 and July 31, 2022.
Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks
described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2022, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 1, 2022 and July 31, 2022, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known
to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, mismatches between supply and demand can occur, harming our financial results.
Because we do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products, we are dependent on third parties to manufacture and assemble our
products. Our manufacturing lead times are very long, which requires us to make estimates of customers’ future demand. At the same time, we
do not have a guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a
quarter or year, which has previously caused changes to expected revenue and cash flows, and which may reoccur in the future. If our estimates
of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced from time to time, these conditions could lead to a significant mismatch
between supply and demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market
platforms, and significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor
industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, as we have experienced in the past, the lead time on our orders for certain supply
has extended to more than twelve months, compared to a historical lead time of approximately six months. As a result, we have paid premiums
and provided deposits to secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs, and may need to continue to do so in the
future. We may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines. Our supply, which
includes inventory on hand, purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements, has grown significantly due to current supply chain conditions
and complexity of our products. Purchase obligations and prepaid supply agreements represent approximately three quarters of our total supply.
Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, time to market, competitor product
releases and announcements, competing technologies, and changes in macroeconomic conditions, including rising inflation and fluctuating
interest rates. Each of these factors has previously impacted, and can in the future impact, the timing and volume of our revenue. Our demand
predictions may not be correct, as we have experienced from time to time. Product transitions are complex and frequently negatively impact our
revenue as we manage shipments of legacy prior architecture products and channel partners prepare and adjust to support new products. We
have recently begun transitioning architectures for both our Gaming and Data Center products, which may impair our ability to predict demand
and impact our supply mix. We may experience, and have in the past experienced, reduced demand for current generation architectures when
customers anticipate transitions. Although we have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, this trend may not continue
for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our financial
results may be negatively impacted. Our ability to sell certain products has in the past been and can in the future be impeded if components from
third parties that are necessary for the finished product are not available. Additionally, we sell most of our products through channel partners,
who sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers and distributors in
response to changing market conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to
impact our ability to properly forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.
35

If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner, or our original equipment
manufacturers may experience supply constraints. If we fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships
could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed.
On the other hand, if we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, and if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to
purchase from our competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a
reduction in average selling prices, including as a result of channel pricing programs that we have implemented in the past and may continue to
implement, as a result of our overestimation of future demand, which has reduced our revenue and gross margins, and we may need to continue
these reductions. We have had to increase prices for our Data Center products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and may need to
continue to do so for other products in the future, which may negatively impact demand. We have also written-down our inventory, incurred
cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments, negatively impacting our gross margins and our overall financial results. These impacts were
amplified by our placement of non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be
exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased recently, as our purchase
obligations and prepaids have grown and become a greater portion of our total supply while our revenue has sequentially declined.
In addition to the growing lead times described above, there are many factors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either
underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for
our products. Those factors include such things as:
• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased consumer confidence, including downturns in our target markets
and/or overall economy, rising inflation, currency fluctuations, and changes in the credit market;
• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control COVID-19 case spread;
• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
• new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products;
• new or unexpected end use cases;
• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
• fluctuations in demand for our products related to cryptocurrency mining; or
• changes in governmental policies, such as increased restrictions on gaming usage or cloud service providers.
COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create supply and logistics constraints. The war in
Ukraine has further strained global supply chains and may in the future result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our
foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. Extended lead times may continue if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural
disasters or other events. In addition, geopolitical tensions involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and
where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse
impact on us.
Our products are designed for the Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization and Automotive markets. The use of our GPUs for use cases
other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and can in the future impact
demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, many years ago, our Gaming GPUs
began to be used for digital currency mining, including blockchain-based platforms such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any
reasonable degree of precision, the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on
demand for our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies,
government cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain
transactions, has impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to
estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the recently implemented
Ethereum 2.0 merge
36

may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining as well as create increased aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively
impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum
mining capability and provided CMP products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. With the Ethereum 2.0
merge, NVIDIA Ampere and Ada Lovelace architectures no longer include LHR. In addition, our new products or previously sold products may be
resold online or on the unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products or reseller
marketplaces compete with our distribution channels.
Restrictions may be imposed or reinstated as the pandemic resurfaces, such as ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment
efforts in China. End customer sales for our products in China have been negatively impacted and this impact may continue if future and
continued lockdowns occur. These ongoing COVID-19-related disruptions and lockdowns in China have created and may continue to create
supply chain and logistics constraints. Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global
and regional basis.
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, package or design our products, which reduces our
control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could
harm our business.
We do not manufacture the semiconductors used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. We depend on foundries
to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques. We do not assemble, test or package our products,
but instead contract with independent subcontractors. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design,
simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for
greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. While we have entered in the past
and may in the future enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity
to address our business needs. We face several risks which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply
chain, negatively impact longer-term demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our business operations, gross margin,
revenue and/or financial results, including:
• lack of guaranteed supply of wafers, components and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component prices, from
incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place orders with our suppliers with sufficient quantities or in a timely manner;
• failure by our foundries or contract manufacturers to procure raw materials or to provide adequate levels of manufacturing or test
capacity for our products;
• failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality process technologies, including transitions to smaller
geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our
products;
• limited number of global suppliers, foundries, contract manufacturers, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and
commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;
• lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules;
• suppliers or their suppliers failing to supply high quality products and/or making changes to their products without our qualification;
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or
foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over ours;
• requirements to place orders that are not cancellable upon changes in demand or requirements to prepay for supply in advance;
• low manufacturing yields resulting from a failure in our product design or a foundry’s proprietary process technology; and
37

• disruptions in manufacturing, assembly and other processes due to heat wave closures and electricity conservation efforts.
We have incurred and could in the future incur significant expenses to remediate defects in our products, which can damage our
reputation and cause us to lose market share.
Our hardware and software product offerings are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain defects or security
vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials
and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications
or as new versions are released. These risks further increase when we rely on partners to supply and manufacture components that are used in
our products, as these arrangements reduce our direct control over production. Although arrangements with component providers may contain
provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defects that may
occur from time to time. Some failures in our products or services have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after a product
or service has been shipped or used. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could result in loss of data or intangible property,
or expose our end customers to unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malicious software programs that could attack our products
or services. Defects or failure of our products to perform to specifications could lead to substantial damage to the products or the product in
which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such
defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs as part of a product recall or otherwise, write-off the
value of related inventory, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the
issue. Our efforts to remedy these issues may not be timely or may not be satisfactory to our customers. An error or defect in new products or
releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, loss of
design wins, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, and harm to our relationships with existing and prospective
customers and partners and consumers’ perceptions of our brand, which would in turn negatively impact our business operations, gross margin,
revenue and/or financial results. We may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including for costs to repair or replace
products in the field or in connection with indemnification obligations, or pay fines imposed by regulatory agencies.
For example, a defect was identified in a third-party component embedded in certain Data Center products. This defect has had, and other
defects may in the future have, an adverse effect on our cost and supply of components and finished goods. While we have been working to fix
the defect, we have needed to replace those products instead of repairing them, resulting in greater costs to us. These costs could be significant
in future periods. We recorded $122 million for warranty reserves in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 primarily in connection with this
defect. While we believe we have accurately recorded for the warranty reserve, we may need to record additional amounts in the future if our
estimate proves to be incorrect. Additionally, we are investigating failures of power connectors shipped with our recently launched GeForce RTX
4090, which may harm sales of the 4090 or future products. In general, if a product liability claim regarding any of our products is brought against
us, even if the alleged damage is due to the actions or inactions of a third party, such as within our supply chain, the cost of defending the claim
could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business. Further, our business
liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial
results.
Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,
telecommunications failures, cloud service provider outages, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other
military actions, epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our corporate headquarters, a large
portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical
business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our operations vulnerable to natural
disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. Catastrophic events can also have
an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel.
Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase economic volatility globally. Political
instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also
likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if
manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages,
information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,
38

environmental, public health, or political issues. For example, the war in Ukraine has had and will likely continue to have a negative impact on
our employees or operations both within and outside Ukraine. In connection with multiple sanctions on Russia, we stopped direct sales to Russia
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and closed business operations in Russia in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Additionally, the ongoing
war could result in a shortage of key materials that our suppliers, including our foundry partners, require to satisfy our needs. The ultimate impact
on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a
disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business could be harmed as a
result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks
and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees and
recruit and develop diverse talent. Labor is subject to external factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive
market for skilled workers and leaders, cost inflation, the COVID-19 pandemic and workforce participation rates. We also must recruit and
develop diverse talent. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to
attract and retain qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our business may
be adversely affected. Competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation, and in times of
stock price volatility, as we have experienced recently, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. We also must retain
the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of those transactions. We are highly dependent
on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, transfer of knowledge and smooth
transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long-term success.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of
operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our workforce and operations and those of our customers, partners, vendors
and suppliers. As the pandemic continues to evolve, the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty, and the limited
availability of our supply chain, logistical services and component supply, may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial
results. COVID-19 containment around the world has put restrictions on, among other areas, manufacturing facilities, commerce, and support
operations, which could limit our capacity to meet customer demand. For example, ongoing lockdown measures due to COVID-19 containment
efforts in China have impacted end customer sales, disrupted our partners’ operations, created logistics and delivery bottlenecks, and further
curtailed supply, and may continue to do so in the future.
COVID-19’s effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict. It has resulted in, and may continue to result in,
disruption of global financial markets, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity. Volatility in the financial markets could impact
overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.
We have modified our business and workforce practices in response to COVID-19, and we may take further actions as required by government
regulations or in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that our actions will be sufficient to
mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. As our offices have reopened, we have
incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental expenses and related in-office costs as we resume onsite services.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business
strategies may continue to be difficult to measure and predict. We have experienced supply chain and economic disruption, in part as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic which has negatively impacted and could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations,
financial condition, and access to sources of liquidity.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other
actions may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership
and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption; business
39

acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;
employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;
cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,
and may impact our business operations negatively. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and
regulations prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or
agents will not violate policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws. Violations of
these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our
business; and damage to our reputation. Should any of these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we
could incur materially greater compliance costs and/or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. For
example, we may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in anti-competition legislation, regulation, administrative
rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks, and enforcement activity resulting from growing public
concern over concentration of economic power in corporations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions, trade and economic sanctions, decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions
could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and employees, do business without an export license with entities on
the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to
time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, in response to the war in
Ukraine, the United States and certain allies have imposed economic sanctions and export control measures and may impose additional
sanctions or export control measures, which have resulted in and could in the future result in, among other things, severe or complete
restrictions on exports to and other commerce and business dealings involving Russia, Belarus, certain regions of Ukraine, and/or particular
entities and individuals. Such actions have limited or blocked, or could in the future limit or block the passage of our products, services and
support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine or other regions determined to be supporting Russia, which may result in claims
brought against us for failure to fulfill our contractual obligations, and restrict access by our employees (both within and outside of Ukraine) to our
systems, negatively impacting productivity. Given these recent sanctions and export restrictions imposed by the United States and foreign
government bodies, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we paused all direct sales to Russia, and during the third quarter of fiscal year
2023, we closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted end customer sales in EMEA and may continue
to do so in the future. While we have policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with sanctions and trade restrictions, our
employees, contractors, partners, and agents may take actions in violations of such policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately
held responsible. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S. laws, even if
the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could have a
material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, changes in the public perception of
governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Geopolitical tensions and conflicts worldwide, including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of
our product components and final assembly of our products are concentrated, may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies,
export controls, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets,
hiring, and profitability. The increasing focus on the strategic importance of AI technologies may result in additional regulatory restrictions that
target products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, including some or all of our product and service offerings. Such restrictions
could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI technologies. As
geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are increasingly the focus of
export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will
be adopted. Such controls may be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or
more markets, including but not limited to China, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options,
or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue,
and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which are increasingly likely, would restrict our
ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive
disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Increasing use of economic sanctions may also impact demand
for our products or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to
include deemed export control limitations that negatively
40

impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export
restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China,
that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which could
also substantially reduce our revenue.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or USG, announced new license requirements that, with certain exceptions,
impact exports to China (including Hong Kong) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which
incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits and our A100X. The new license requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit
achieving both peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance equal to or greater than thresholds that are roughly equivalent to the A100,
as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. We are also required to obtain a license to export a wide array of products, including
networking products destined for certain end users and any system in China that can achieve single precision performance of 200 Petaops, or
double precision performance of 100 Petaops, within a 41,600 cubic feet envelope.
We will be required to transition certain operations out of China, which could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research
and development and supply and distribution operations, as well as our revenue, during any such transition period.
We have engaged with customers in China to satisfy their demand with products not subject to the new license requirements, such as our new
A800 offering. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the new license requirements, we may seek a license for the customer
but have no assurance that the USG will grant any exemptions or licenses for any customer, or that the USG will act on them in a timely manner.
The new requirements may have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell
products that are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Our revenue, profitability, cash flows, and competitive position may be harmed if customers in China do not want to purchase our alternative
product offerings, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, or if the USG does not grant licenses in
a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers. Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or
impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The new requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the
licensing process will make our sales and support efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue
alternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our Gaming
revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. Additionally, revisions to laws or
regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import
duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business
plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Furthermore, a tariff exclusion on our graphics cards is scheduled to expire in December 2022. If we
are unable to obtain an extension of this tariff exclusion, or if the value of our graphics cards increases due to our adoption of a change in tariff
valuation methodology, our profitability may be negatively impacted.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
On May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase additional common stock up to a
total of $15 billion through December 2023. Since the inception of our share repurchase program through October 30, 2022, we have
repurchased an aggregate of 1.10 billion shares for $16.07 billion through October 30, 2022. As of October 30, 2022, we were authorized,
subject to certain specifications, to repurchase an additional $8.28 billion of shares through December 2023.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or in structured
share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA
to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we paid $100 million and $300 million in cash dividends to our shareholders,
respectively.

From October 31, 2022 through November 17, 2022, we repurchased 7 million shares for $1.05 billion pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted
stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, we withheld approximately 2
million shares at a total cost of $294 million through net share settlements. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, we withheld
approximately 6 million shares at a total cost of $1.13 billion through net share settlements.
