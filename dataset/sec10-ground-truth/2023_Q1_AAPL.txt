Apple Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal
years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (net
income in millions and shares in thousands):
Three Months Ended

Basic earnings per share $ 1.89 $ 2.11
Diluted earnings per share $ 1.88 $ 2.10
Approximately 89 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended
December 31, 2022 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

$3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended December 25, 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 9, “Segment Information
and Geographic Data” for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a
moderately higher proportion of net sales.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term
debt–related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.
The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

Derivative liabilities :

Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ — $ 1,367
(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective
counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party
to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of both December 31, 2022 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which
accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 43% and 44% of total trade receivables as of December 31,
2022 and September 24, 2022, respectively.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 16%. As of
September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54%

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding
the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or
periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the
“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance
matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not
incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years
2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.
Quarterly Highlights
Total net sales decreased 5% or $6.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies
relative to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of
iPad.
During the first quarter of 2023, the Company announced a new iPad, a new iPad Pro powered by the Apple M2 chip, and a new Apple TV 4K.
The Company repurchased $19.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.8 billion during the first quarter of 2023.

COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented
measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19
pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19
pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of
operations and financial condition.
Certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced, and could in the future experience,
disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. During the first quarter of 2023, COVID-related impacts temporarily affected the
Company’s primary iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max assembly facility located in Zhengzhou, China. The facility operated at significantly reduced capacity,
impacting iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone Pro Max shipments.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates and currency fluctuations, have direct and indirect impacts on the Company’s business. The
Company believes these factors have impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
Segment Operating Performance
The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and
Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic
region. Further information regarding the Company’s reportable segments can be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, “Segment Information and Geographic Data.”
The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (dollars in millions):

Americas
Americas net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially

Americas net sales during the first quarter of 2023.
Europe
Europe net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S.
dollar, which contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac.

Greater China
Greater China net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the renminbi relative to the
U.S. dollar. The weakness of the renminbi contributed to lower net sales of iPhone, which was partially offset by higher net sales of iPad.

Japan net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar,
which contributed to lower net sales of Services and Mac.
Rest of Asia Pacific
Rest of Asia Pacific net sales decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar. The weakness in foreign currencies contributed to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, which was partially offset by higher net sales of Services
and iPad.

currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Services Gross Margin
Services gross margin increased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset
by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
Services gross margin percentage decreased during the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to the weakness in foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.
The Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk
Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

increases in headcount-related expenses.

as follows (dollars in millions):

Effective tax rate 15.8 % 16.0 %
Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 %
The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on
foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the same quarter in 2022 due primarily to a higher U.S. federal R&D credit,
lower state income taxes and a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, largely offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing
purchase obligations.
Commercial Paper
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2022, the
Company had $1.7 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.
Apple Inc. | Q1 2023 Form 10-Q | 19

Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of December 31, 2022,
the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $55.1 billion, with $54.8 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The share repurchase program
(the “Program”) does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was
$0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s
critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to
market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022
Form 10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with
management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the
Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. The
Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to
nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The Northern
California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an
injunction. Epic appealed the decision. The Company filed a cross-appeal and has been granted a stay pending the appeal.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial
condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting
period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors

NOTICE OF GRANT

No. of Units Subject to Award:
Award Date: (the “Award Date”)

Vesting Schedule:
This restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) is granted under and governed by the terms and conditions of the Apple Inc. 2022
Employee Stock Plan and the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award, which are incorporated herein by reference.
You do not have to accept the Award. If you wish to decline your Award, you should promptly notify Apple Inc.’s Stock Plan Group of your
decision at peoplesupport@apple.com. If you do not provide such notification by the last day of the calendar month prior to the first Vesting Date,
you will be deemed to have accepted your Award on the terms and conditions set forth herein.

APPLE INC.
2022 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN
RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
1. General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular restricted stock unit
award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in the Notice of Grant
(the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is referred to as the
“Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The Award was granted
under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the “Plan”). Capitalized terms
are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in addition to, and not in lieu of,
any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these Terms are collectively referred to
as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the Award.
2. RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to
be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. RSUs shall be used solely as a device for the
determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall not
be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice. (Each
vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date.”) Unless and until the Company elects to issue fractional
Shares in settlement of a vested RSU, any fractional RSUs that vest on a Vesting Date shall be carried forward and vest when such combined
fractional RSUs result in a full RSU and any fractional RSU that is not carried forward as a result of a termination of the Award prior to the next
subsequent Vesting Date shall be forfeited.
4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued
active employment or service through each applicable Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the applicable installment of the Award and
the rights and benefits under this Award Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the period between the Vesting Commencement
Date and the first Vesting Date or between subsequent Vesting Dates, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any
proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of
absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as
approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal
leave of absence.
Nothing contained in this Award Agreement or the Plan constitutes an employment or service commitment by the Company, affects the
Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain
employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to
terminate such employment or service, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other
compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant
without the Participant’s consent thereto.
1

5. Dividend and Voting Rights.
(a) Limitations on Rights Associated with RSUs. The Participant shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Company, no
dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the
RSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the
Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the
stock as reflected in the book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b) Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its
Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its
Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan) subject to
the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend Equivalent
Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms,
conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided, however,
that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made
pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which, immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid
pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8.
6. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any
interest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,
alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
7. Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following each Vesting Date determined
pursuant to Section 3 or Section 8 or following the Participant’s death as specified in Section 8(d) (and in all events not later than two and onehalf (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date or the date of the Participant’s death, as applicable), the Company shall deliver to the Participant a
number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as determined by
the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant’s Retirement, death
or Disability, are treated as vesting) on the applicable Vesting Date or the Participant’s death, as applicable, less Tax-Related Items, unless such
RSUs terminate prior to the given Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment
with respect to vested RSUs is subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any
Shares with respect to the vested RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to
Section 13(c) of the Plan. The Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to
Section 8.
8. Effect of Termination of Service.
(a) Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend
Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning
the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”),
regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily, or whether the
Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.
2

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant’s
Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, any unvested
RSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d))
without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service, determined by multiplying (i) the number of RSUs eligible to vest on the applicable
Vesting Date, by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of days that have elapsed between the Award Date and the
Participant’s Retirement date, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days contained in the period between the Award Date
and the applicable Vesting Date. For purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after
the Participant both has reached the age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary
(including service with any entity acquired by the Company) as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In
the event the Participant’s Termination of Service occurs prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless
the Committee shall otherwise determine. For purposes of this Section 8(b), a Termination of Service shall not include the Participant’s
Termination of Service resulting from the Participant’s Disability or death (in which case Section 8(c) or 8(d), as applicable, will apply).
(c) In the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Disability, any unvested RSUs shall continue
to be eligible to vest in full (in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice and Section 8(d)) without regard to the Participant’s
Termination of Service.
(d) In the event of the Participant’s Termination of Service due to the Participant’s death, all unvested RSUs eligible to vest on
Vesting Date(s) subsequent to the Participant’s death shall accelerate and vest immediately, and upon the Participant’s death following the
Participant’s Termination of Service due to Disability or Retirement any RSUs that were eligible to vest in full, or pro rata in the case of
Retirement, will be settled as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant’s death in accordance with Section 7.
(e) If any unvested RSUs are terminated hereunder, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend Equivalent Rights) shall
automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date without payment of any consideration by the Company and
without any other action by the Participant or the Participant’s personal representative, as the case may be.
9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company
may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:
(a) during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment
Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense
under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);
3

(b) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of
confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,
embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.
For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s
behalf, to any brokerage firm or third party administrator holding the Participant’s Shares and other amounts acquired under the Plan to reconvey, transfer, or otherwise return such Shares and other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the Company’s exclusive remedy
with respect to such matters.
10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by
Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in
accordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of
the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent Rights are credited
pursuant to Section 5(b).
11. Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company or the Participant’s employer
(“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that
the Company and the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any Shares
acquired at vesting, and the receipt of any dividends or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to
structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any
particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant acknowledges that the
Company or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one
jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the
Company or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company or the Employer, or their
respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable
withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
(a) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term cash incentives, payable to the Participant
by the Company or the Employer;
(b) withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid
upon vesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s
direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;
4

(d) withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or
(e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then
the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,
by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method
(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of
methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,
including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s jurisdiction(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded
to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek
a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items
directly to the applicable tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number
of Shares as described herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested
RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may
refuse to issue or deliver to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the
Participant’s obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.
12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by
electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive
all applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line or voice activated system established and
maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.
13. Data Privacy. By participating in the Plan, the Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and
transfer of personal data as described in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information
about the Participant, including the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security
number or other employee identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs
or any other entitlement to Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s
favor, for the purpose of managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may transfer Data amongst
themselves as necessary for the purpose of implementation, administration, and management of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and
the Company and its related entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the
implementation, administration, and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data
may be located anywhere in the world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or
other form, for the purposes of implementing, administering, and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any transfer of
such Data as may be required for the administration of the Plan and the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or
to other third party with whom the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or
otherwise).
5

14. Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its
principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at
such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the
Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly
sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office
or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
15. Plan. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the
provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.
The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise
expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the
Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are
otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan
after the date hereof.
16. Entire Agreement. This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award
Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The
Company may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the
Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any
other provision hereof.
17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This
Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as
creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a
general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the RSUs, and rights
no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when payable hereunder.
18. Section Headings. The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect any provision hereof.
19. Governing Law. This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of California and applicable U.S. federal laws without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.
20. Choice of Venue. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties
evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that
such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern District of California,
and no other courts, where this grant is made or to be performed.
21. Construction. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A
of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted with that intent.
6

22. Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal
or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
23. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s
participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD
PERFORMANCE AWARD
1. General. These Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Award - Performance Award (these “Terms”) apply to a particular
restricted stock unit award (the “Award”) granted by Apple Inc., a California corporation (the “Company”), and are incorporated by reference in
the Notice of Grant (the “Grant Notice”) corresponding to that particular grant. The recipient of the Award identified in the Grant Notice is
referred to as the “Participant.” The effective date of grant of the Award as set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to as the “Award Date.” The
Award was granted under and is subject to the provisions of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan, as amended from time to time (the
“Plan”). Capitalized terms are defined in the Plan if not defined herein. The Award is discretionary and has been granted to the Participant in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any other form of compensation otherwise payable or to be paid to the Participant. The Grant Notice and these
Terms (including Exhibit A hereto, incorporated herein by this reference) are collectively referred to as the “Award Agreement” applicable to the
Award.
2. RSUs. As used herein, the term “RSU” shall mean a non-voting unit of measurement which is deemed for bookkeeping purposes to
be equivalent to one outstanding Share solely for purposes of the Plan and this Award Agreement. The RSUs shall be used solely as a device
for the determination of the payment to eventually be made to the Participant if such RSUs vest pursuant to this Award Agreement. The RSUs
shall not be treated as property or as a trust fund of any kind.
3. Vesting. Subject to Sections 4 and 8 below, the Award shall vest and become nonforfeitable as set forth in the Grant Notice and
Exhibit A hereto. (The vesting date set forth in the Grant Notice is referred to herein as a “Vesting Date”).
4. Continuance of Employment. Except as provided in this Section 4 and in Section 8 below, vesting of the Award requires continued
active employment or service through the Vesting Date as a condition to the vesting of the Award and the rights and benefits under this Award
Agreement. Employment or service for only a portion of the vesting period, even if a substantial portion, will not entitle the Participant to any
proportionate vesting of the Award. For purposes of this Award Agreement, active service shall include (a) the duration of an approved leave of
absence (other than a personal leave of absence) and (b) the first thirty (30) days of an approved personal leave of absence, in each case as
approved by the Company, in its sole discretion. The vesting of the Award shall be tolled beginning on the thirty-first (31st) day of a personal
leave of absence.

Participant’s status as an employee at will who is subject to termination with or without cause, confers upon the Participant any right to remain
employed by or in service to the Company or any Subsidiary, interferes in any way with the right of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time to
terminate such employment or services, or affects the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to increase or decrease the Participant’s other
compensation or benefits. Nothing in this Section 4, however, is intended to adversely affect any independent contractual right of the Participant
without the Participant’s consent thereto.

5. Dividend and Voting Rights.

dividend rights (except as expressly provided in Section 5(b) with respect to Dividend Equivalent Rights) and no voting rights, with respect to the
RSUs or any Shares underlying or issuable in respect of such RSUs until such Shares are actually issued to and held of record by the
Participant. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the
book entry evidencing such Shares.
(b) Dividend Equivalent Rights Distributions. As of any date that the Company pays an ordinary cash dividend on its
Shares, the Company shall credit the Participant with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per share cash dividend paid by the Company on its
Shares on such date, multiplied by (ii) the total target number of RSUs (with such total number adjusted pursuant to Section 11 of the Plan)
subject to the Award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for that dividend (a “Dividend Equivalent Right”). Any Dividend
Equivalent Rights credited pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(b) shall be subject to the same vesting, payment and other
terms, conditions and restrictions as the original RSUs to which they relate, including the obligation to satisfy the Tax-Related Items; provided,
however, that the amount of any vested Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be paid in cash. For purposes of clarity, the percentage of the Dividend
Equivalent Rights that are paid will correspond to the percentage of the total target number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date, after giving
effect to Exhibit A. No crediting of Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be made pursuant to this Section 5(b) with respect to any RSUs which,
immediately prior to the record date for that dividend, have either been paid pursuant to Section 7 or terminated pursuant to Section 8 or Exhibit
A.
6. Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in Section 4(c) of the Plan, the Award, the Dividend Equivalent Rights and any
interest therein or amount or Shares payable in respect thereof shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of,
alienated or encumbered, either voluntarily or involuntarily.
7. Timing and Manner of Payment of RSUs. On or as soon as administratively practical following the Vesting Date pursuant to
Section 3 or Section 8 (and in all events not later than two and one-half (2 ½) months after such Vesting Date), the Company shall deliver to the
Participant a number of Shares (either by delivering one or more certificates for such Shares or by entering such Shares in book entry form, as
determined by the Company in its discretion) equal to the number of RSUs subject to the Award that vest (or, in the case of the Participant’s
Retirement, death or Disability, are treated as vesting) on the Vesting Date, less Tax-Related Items, unless such RSUs terminate prior to the
Vesting Date pursuant to Section 8. The Company’s obligation to deliver Shares or otherwise make payment with respect to vested RSUs is
subject to the condition precedent that the Participant or other person entitled under the Plan to receive any Shares with respect to the vested
RSUs deliver to the Company any representations or other documents or assurances required pursuant to Section 13(c) of the Plan. The
Participant shall have no further rights with respect to any RSUs that are paid or that terminate pursuant to Section 8.
8. Effect of Termination of Service.
(a) Except as expressly provided in Section 4 or this Section 8, the Participant’s RSUs (as well as the related Dividend
Equivalent Rights) shall terminate to the extent such RSUs have not become vested prior to the Participant’s Termination of Service, meaning
the first date the Participant is no longer employed by or providing services to the Company or one of its Subsidiaries (the “Severance Date”),
regardless of the reason for the Participant’s Termination of Service, whether with or without cause, voluntarily or involuntarily or whether the
Participant was employed or provided services for a portion of the vesting period prior to a Vesting Date.
2

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as otherwise provided by the Committee, in the event of the Participant’s
Termination of Service due to the Participant’s Retirement (defined below) on or after the first anniversary of the Award Date, death or Disability,
any unvested RSUs shall continue to be eligible to vest on the Vesting Date without regard to the Participant’s Termination of Service. For
purposes of this Award Agreement, “Retirement” means the Participant’s Termination of Service on or after the Participant both has reached the
age of sixty (60) and has completed ten (10) years of service with the Company, or any Subsidiary (including service with any entity acquired by
the Company), as of the Severance Date, as determined in the sole discretion of the Committee. In the event the Participant’s Termination of
Service occurs due to Retirement prior to the first anniversary of the Award Date, this Section 8(b) shall not apply, unless the Committee shall
otherwise determine.
(c) If any unvested RSUs are terminated pursuant to this Award Agreement, such RSUs (as well as the related Dividend
Equivalent Rights) shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the applicable Severance Date (or, to the extent that any RSUs remain
outstanding following the Severance Date by reason of Section 8(b) but the applicable performance-based vesting conditions are not satisfied,
such RSUs shall automatically terminate and be cancelled as of the Vesting Date, as provided in Exhibit A) without payment of any consideration
by the Company and without any other action by the Participant, or the Participant’s beneficiary or personal representative, as the case may be.
9. Recoupment. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, shall be subject to any recoupment, “clawback” or similar provisions of applicable law. In addition, the Company
may require the Participant to deliver or otherwise repay to the Company the Award and any Shares or other amount or property that may be
issued, delivered or paid in respect of the Award, as well as any consideration that may be received in respect of a sale or other disposition of
any such Shares or property, if the Company reasonably determines that one or more of the following has occurred:
(a) during the period of the Participant’s employment or service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the “Employment
Period”), the Participant has committed a felony (under the laws of the United States or any relevant state, or a similar crime or offense
under the applicable laws of any relevant foreign jurisdiction);
(b) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in a breach of
confidentiality, or an unauthorized disclosure or use of inside information, customer lists, trade secrets or other confidential information of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(c) during the Employment Period or at any time thereafter, the Participant has committed or engaged in an act of theft,
embezzlement or fraud, or materially breached any agreement to which the Participant is a party with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.
For purposes of the foregoing, the Participant expressly and explicitly authorizes the Company to issue instructions, on the Participant’s
behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Company to hold the Participant’s Shares and other amounts
acquired under the Plan to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return such Shares and/or other amounts to the Company. This Section 9 is not the
Company’s exclusive remedy with respect to such matters.
10. Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company’s stock contemplated by
Section 11 of the Plan (including, without limitation, an extraordinary cash dividend on such stock), the Committee shall make adjustments in
accordance with such section in the number of RSUs then outstanding and the number and kind of securities that may be
3

issued in respect of the Award. No such adjustment shall be made with respect to any ordinary cash dividend for which Dividend Equivalent
Rights are credited pursuant to Section 5(b).
11. Responsibility for Taxes. The Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action the Company and/or the Participant’s
employer (“Employer”) take with respect to any Tax-Related Items, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Participant’s
responsibility and may exceed the amount, if any, actually withheld by the Company or the Employer. The Participant further acknowledges that
the Company and/or the Employer (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection
with any aspect of the Award, including the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the delivery of Shares, the subsequent sale of any
Shares acquired at vesting and the receipt of any dividends and/or Dividend Equivalent Rights; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no
obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate the Participant’s liability for Tax-Related Items or
achieve any particular tax result. Further, if the Participant is or becomes subject to tax in more than one jurisdiction, the Participant
acknowledges that the Company and/or the Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for TaxRelated Items in more than one jurisdiction.
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, the Participant shall pay or make arrangements satisfactory to the
Company and/or the Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, the Participant authorizes the Company and/or the Employer, or
their respective agents, at their discretion and pursuant to such procedures as they may specify from time to time, to satisfy any applicable
withholding obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:
(a) withholding from any wages or other cash compensation, including short-term cash incentives, payable to the Participant
by the Company and/or the Employer;
(b) withholding otherwise deliverable Shares and/or from otherwise payable Dividend Equivalent Rights to be issued or paid
upon vesting/settlement of the Award;
(c) arranging for the sale of Shares otherwise deliverable to the Participant (on the Participant’s behalf and at the Participant’s
direction pursuant to this authorization), including selling Shares as part of a block trade with other Participants in the Plan;
(d) withholding from the proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon vesting/settlement of the Award; or
(e) any other method of withholding determined by the Company to be permitted under the Plan and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law or under the Plan, approved by the Committee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant is an officer of the Company who is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, then
the Company must satisfy any withholding obligations arising upon the occurrence of a taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable,
by withholding Shares otherwise deliverable or an amount otherwise payable upon settlement of Dividend Equivalent Rights pursuant to method
(b), unless the Board or the Committee determines in its discretion to satisfy the obligation for Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of
methods (a), (b), (c), and (d) above.
The Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates,
including maximum rates applicable in the Participant’s jurisdictions(s). If the maximum rate is used, any over-withheld amount may be refunded
to the Participant in cash by the Company or Employer (with no entitlement to the Share equivalent) or if not refunded, the Participant may seek
a refund from the local tax authorities. In the event of under-withholding, the Participant may be required to pay additional Tax-Related Items
directly to the applicable
4

tax authority or to the Company or Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding a number of Shares as described
herein, for tax purposes, the Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding
that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver
to the Participant any Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares if the Participant fails to comply with the Participant’s obligations in
connection with the Tax-Related Items.
12. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Company may, in its sole discretion, deliver any documents related to the Award by
electronic means or request the Participant’s consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. The Participant hereby consents to receive
all applicable documentation by electronic delivery and to participate in the Plan through an on-line (and/or voice activated) system established
and maintained by the Company or a third party vendor designated by the Company.
13. Data Privacy. The Participant acknowledges and consents to the collection, use, processing and transfer of personal data as
described in this Section 13. The Company, its related entities, and the Employer hold certain personal information about the Participant,
including the Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number or other employee
identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to
Shares or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in the Participant’s favor, for the purpose of
managing and administering the Plan (“Data”). The Company and its related entities may transfer Data amongst themselves as necessary for
the purpose of implementation, administration and management of the Participant’s participation in the Plan, and the Company and its related
entities may each further transfer Data to any third parties assisting the Company or any such related entity in the implementation, administration
and management of the Plan. The Participant acknowledges that the transferors and transferees of such Data may be located anywhere in the
world and hereby authorizes each of them to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the purposes of
implementing, administering and managing the Participant’s participation in the Plan, including any transfer of such Data as may be required for
the administration of the Plan and/or the subsequent holding of Shares on the Participant’s behalf to a broker or to other third party with whom
the Participant may elect to deposit any Shares acquired under the Plan (whether pursuant to the Award or otherwise).
14. Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Award Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at its
principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Participant at the Participant’s last address reflected on the Company’s records, or at
such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be given only when received, but if the
Participant is no longer an employee of the Company, shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly
sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office
or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
15. Plan. The Award and all rights of the Participant under this Award Agreement are subject to the terms and conditions of the
provisions of the Plan, incorporated herein by reference. The Participant agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan and this Award Agreement.
The Participant acknowledges having read and understood the Plan, the Prospectus for the Plan, and this Award Agreement. Unless otherwise
expressly provided in other sections of this Award Agreement, provisions of the Plan that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the
Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Participant unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are
otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan
after the date hereof.
5

16. Entire Agreement. This Award Agreement and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior
understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Award
Agreement may be amended pursuant to Section 15 of the Plan. Such amendment must be in writing and signed by the Company. The
Company may, however, unilaterally waive any provision hereof in writing to the extent such waiver does not adversely affect the interests of the
Participant hereunder, but no such waiver shall operate as or be construed to be a subsequent waiver of the same provision or a waiver of any
other provision hereof.
17. Limitation on the Participant’s Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This
Award Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as
creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Participant shall have only the rights of a
general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable, if any, with respect to the RSUs, and rights
no greater than the right to receive the Shares as a general unsecured creditor with respect to RSUs, as and when payable hereunder.
18. Section Headings. The section headings of this Award Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed
to alter or affect any provision hereof.
19. Governing Law. This Award Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of California without regard to conflict of law principles thereunder.
20. Choice of Venue. For purposes of litigating any dispute that arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties
evidenced by this grant or this Award Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that
such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the Northern District of California,
and no other courts, where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
21. Construction. It is intended that the terms of the Award will not result in the imposition of any tax liability pursuant to Section 409A
of the Code. This Award Agreement shall be construed and interpreted consistent with that intent.
22. Severability. The provisions of this Award Agreement are severable and if any one of more provisions are determined to be illegal
or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable.
23. Imposition of Other Requirements. The Company reserves the right to impose other requirements on the Participant’s
participation in the Plan, on the RSUs and on any Shares acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company determines it is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons, and to require the Participant to sign any additional agreements or undertakings that may be
necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

PERFORMANCE AWARD
EXHIBIT A
PERFORMANCE VESTING REQUIREMENTS
The RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) subject to the Award that will vest on the Vesting Date will be determined based on
the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) Percentile for the Performance Period.
The percentage of the RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent Rights) that vest on the Vesting Date will be determined as follows:
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile or greater, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs
will vest on the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is at the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the target RSUs will vest on
the Vesting Date.
• If the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period is below the [ ] ([ ]) percentile, [ ] ([ ]%) of the RSUs will vest on the
Vesting Date.
For TSR Percentile performance for the Performance Period between the levels indicated above, the portion of the RSUs that will vest
on the Vesting Date will be determined on a straight-line basis (i.e., linearly interpolated) between the two nearest vesting percentages indicated
above.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is negative, in no event shall more than one hundred
percent (100%) of the target RSUs vest.
The number of RSUs that vest on the Vesting Date will be rounded to the nearest whole unit, and the balance of the RSUs will not vest
and will terminate on that Vesting Date.
For purposes of the Award, the following definitions will apply:
• “TSR Percentile” means the percentile ranking of the Company’s TSR among the TSRs for the Comparison Group members for
the Performance Period. In determining the Company’s TSR Percentile for the Performance Period, in the event that the
Company’s TSR for the Performance Period is equal to the TSR(s) of one or more other Comparison Group members for that
same period, the Company’s TSR Percentile ranking will be determined by ranking the Company’s TSR for that period as being
greater than such other Comparison Group members.
• “Comparison Group” means the Company and each other company included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index on the first
day of the Performance Period and, except as provided below, the common stock (or similar equity security) of which continues
to be listed or traded on a national securities exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event a
member of the Comparison Group files for bankruptcy or liquidates due to an insolvency, such company shall continue to be
treated as a Comparison Group member, and such company’s Ending Price will be treated as $0 if the common stock (or similar
equity security) of such company is no longer listed or
A-1

traded on a national securities exchange on the last trading day of the Performance Period. In the event of a formation of a new
parent company by a Comparison Group member, substantially all of the assets and liabilities of which consist immediately after
the transaction of the equity interests in the original Comparison Group member or the assets and liabilities of such Comparison
Group member immediately prior to the transaction, such new parent company shall be substituted for the Comparison Group
member to the extent (and for such period of time) as its common stock (or similar equity securities) are listed or traded on a
national securities exchange but the common stock (or similar equity securities) of the original Comparison Group member are
not. In the event of a merger or other business combination of two Comparison Group members (including, without limitation, the
acquisition of one Comparison Group member, or all or substantially all of its assets, by another Comparison Group member),
the surviving, resulting or successor entity, as the case may be, shall continue to be treated as a member of the Comparison
Group, provided that the common stock (or similar equity security) of such entity is listed or traded on a national securities
exchange through the last trading day of the Performance Period. With respect to the preceding two sentences, the applicable
stock prices shall be equitably and proportionately adjusted to the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives
of the awards and mitigate the impact of the transaction.
• “TSR” shall be determined with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member by dividing: (a) the sum of (i)
the difference obtained by subtracting the applicable Beginning Price from the applicable Ending Price plus (ii) all dividends and
other distributions during the Performance Period by (b) the applicable Beginning Price. Any non-cash distributions shall be
valued at fair market value. For the purpose of determining TSR, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be
determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.
• “Beginning Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closing
market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days beginning with the first trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining
Beginning Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional
shares of stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.
• “Ending Price” means, with respect to the Company and any other Comparison Group member, the average of the closing
market prices of such company’s common stock on the principal exchange on which such stock is traded for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the Performance Period. For the purpose of determining Ending
Price, the value of dividends and other distributions shall be determined by treating them as reinvested in additional shares of
stock at the closing market price on the date of distribution.
With respect to the computation of TSR, Beginning Price, and Ending Price, there shall also be an equitable and proportionate adjustment to
the extent (if any) necessary to preserve the intended incentives of the awards and mitigate the impact of any stock split, stock dividend or
reverse stock split occurring during the Performance Period (or during the applicable 20-day period in determining Beginning Price or Ending
Price, as the case may be).
In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the determination of the Committee shall be final and binding.
