A Quarter in Review
Total revenue of $11.7 billion was down $6.6 billion or 36% from Q1 2022, as CCG revenue decreased 38%, DCAI revenue decreased 
39%, and NEX revenue decreased 30%. Q1 2023 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with slowing 
consumer and enterprise demand, persistent inflation, and higher interest rates, that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a 
high level of uncertainty with our customers. We believe CCG, DCAI, and NEX customers, among others, tempered purchases to reduce 
their existing inventories and adjust to the macroeconomic uncertainty. CCG revenue decreased due to lower notebook and desktop 
volumes on lower demand, while notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core and older generation products. DCAI 
revenue decreased due to lower server volume resulting from a softening data center market, partially offset by an increase in revenue 
from the FPGA product line. NEX revenue decreased due to lower demand for Edge, Network Xeon, and Ethernet products.

McAfee and the NAND 
divestiture, and the benefit from 
the EC fine reversal).
Lower operating cash flow 
driven primarily by a net

Key Developments
▪ CCG introduced the 13th Gen Intel® Core™ mobile processor family, led by the launch of the first 24-core processor for a laptop, and 
introduced the new Intel vPro® platform powered by the full lineup of 13th Gen Intel Core processors.
▪ DCAI launched the 4thGen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, a critical part of our heterogeneous hardware and software portfolio to
accelerate real-world workloads, including AI, and announced the 5th Gen Xeon Scalable processor. 
▪ NEX launched the 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors with Intel® vRAN Boost, a new general-purpose chip that fully integrates 
Layer 1 acceleration into the Xeon SoC and is designed to eliminate the need for external accelerator cards.
▪ IFS announced a multigeneration agreement with Arm to enable chip designers to build low-power compute system-on-chips (SoCs) 
on the Intel 18A process.

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, 
consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2022 Form 10-K.
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2023 is a 52-week fiscal year; fiscal 2022 
was a 53-week fiscal year, with the extra week included in the first quarter of 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the 
accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is 
unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim 
periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-K where we 
include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
Note 2 : Operating Segments
We previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI. This change is intended to drive a more 
effective go-to-market capability and to accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our 
segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has 
been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating 
segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.
We now manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪ Client Computing (CCG)
▪ Data Center and AI (DCAI)
▪ Network and Edge (NEX)
▪ Mobileye
▪ Intel Foundry Services (IFS)
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, 
including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel® architecture. 
CCG, DCAI and NEX are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye and IFS do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, 
we have elected to disclose the results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are 
aligned to the sponsoring operating segment. 
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally 
allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪ results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
▪ historical results of operations from divested businesses; 
▪ amounts included within restructuring and other charges; 
▪ employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and 
▪ acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill. 
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about 
the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset 
information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments. Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing 
and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating segments, as it is 
included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. 
Because our products are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense 
included as a component of each operating segment's operating income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity 
investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments. Although the CODM uses 
operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting 
policies for segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. There have been no changes to our segment accounting policies 
disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K except for the organizational change described above.

Note 3 : Non-Controlling Interests
Semiconductor Co-Investment Program 
In 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona 
Fab), a VIE for which we and Brookfield own 51% and 49%, respectively. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we fully 
consolidate the results of Arizona Fab into our consolidated financial statements. Generally, contributions will be made to, and 
distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties’ proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and majority 
owner of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory 
output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts 
per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties. 
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of $29.0 billion.
As of April 1, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant and equipment. The assets held by 
Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $2.7 billion as of April 1, 2023
($1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022).
Non-controlling interest in Arizona Fab was $1.3 billion as of April 1, 2023 ($874 million as of December 31, 2022). Net loss attributable to 
non-controlling interest in Arizona Fab was $5 million in the first three months of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first three months of 2022.
Mobileye
In October 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of $1.0 billion. 
As of April 1, 2023, Intel held approximately 94% (94% as of December 31, 2022) of the outstanding equity interest in Mobileye. Noncontrolling interest in Mobileye was $1.0 billion as of April 1, 2023 ($1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022). Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in Mobileye was $5 million in the first three months of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest in the first three months of 2022.

Note 4 : Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number 
of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 
Three Months Ended
(In Millions, Except Per Share Amounts) Apr 1, 2023 Apr 2, 2022
Net income (loss) $ (2,768) $ 8,113

Net income (loss) attributable to Intel (2,758) 8,113

Dilutive effect of employee equity incentive plans — 28 
Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding—diluted 4,154 4,107 
Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel—basic $ (0.66) $ 1.99 
Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel—diluted $ (0.66) $ 1.98 
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method 
to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common 
stock under the stock purchase plan. Due to our net loss in the first three months of 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock 
options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an 
antidilutive effect on diluted earnings per share.
Securities which were anti-dilutive were insignificant and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods 
presented.
Note 5 : Other Financial Statement Details
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as 
sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of 
Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $500 million during the first three months of 2023,
and we did not factor accounts receivable during the first three months of 2022. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we will collect 
payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.

Property, Plant and Equipment
Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. We 
estimate this change resulted in an approximate $360 million increase to gross margin, an approximate $100 million decrease in R&D 
expenses, and an approximate $525 million decrease in ending inventory values in Q1 2023 when compared to what the impact would 
have been using the estimated useful life in place prior to this change.

efficiencies and improve our product execution in alignment with our strategy. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by 
the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be 
reflected in our results of operations.
Restructuring activity for the 2022 Restructuring Program during the first three months of 2023 was as follows:

that was recorded and paid in 2009. Refer to "Note 12: Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
for further information on legal proceedings related to the EC fine.
Note 7 : Investments
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments. 
Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments 
include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, 
money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of April 1, 2023, and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued 
by institutions outside the US.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or 
the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged 
investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest 
and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was $18.2 billion as of April 1, 2023 ($16.2 billion as of December 31, 2022). For 
hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of $90 million in the first three months of 2023 ($411 million of 
net losses in the first three months of 2022). We recorded net losses on the related derivatives of $102 million in the first three months of 
2023 ($377 million of net gains in the first three months of 2022).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $7.0 billion as of April 1, 2023
($10.2 billion as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair value for these periods.

 Over 90% of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may 
sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments. The trading volume restrictions generally apply for as long as 
we own more than 1% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from the rules of the respective exchange.

Note 8 : Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions
Acquisition of Tower Semiconductor
During the first quarter of 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Tower) in a cash-for-stock 
transaction. Tower is a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions. The acquisition is expected to advance our IDM 2.0 strategy 
by accelerating our global end-to-end foundry business. Upon completion of the acquisition, each issued and outstanding ordinary share 
of Tower will be converted into the right to receive $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion
as of the agreement date. We continue to work to close the transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary 
closing conditions. If regulatory approvals are not received prior to August 15, 2023, and the agreement is terminated by either party, we 
may be obligated to pay Tower a termination fee of $353 million. Tower will be included in our IFS operating segment.
Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
On December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business 
for $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND 
OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests in as part of the sale. The transaction will be completed in two 
closings and upon first closing in the first three months 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a pre-tax gain 
of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the 
remaining proceeds of $1.9 billion which remains outstanding as of April 1, 2023, and will be received upon the second closing of the 
transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025.
The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of 
the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in 
the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the 
current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our 
expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics. 
As of April 1, 2023, we also have a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $184 million recorded 
within other current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of approximately $35 million
per quarter in 2023 for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and 
other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries.
Note 9 : Borrowings
In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also amended both our 5-year 
$5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day credit facility 
agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. The revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of April 1, 2023.
We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program. In the 
first quarter of 2023, we settled in cash $2.9 billion of our commercial paper and had $1.0 billion outstanding as of April 1, 2023.
Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified 
redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment 
with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

3 The fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance.
Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current 
period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we 
classify these assets as Level 3. 
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method 
investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, reverse repurchase agreements with 
original maturities greater than three months, and issued debt.

We classify the fair value of grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as 
Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants 
receivable as of April 1, 2023 was $459 million (the aggregate carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $437 million). The aggregate 
carrying value of reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of April 1, 2023 was $0 million (the

Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued 
a charge of $2.2 billion related to litigation involving VLSI, described below. Excluding the VLSI claims described below, management at 
present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial 
position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject 
to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include 
substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate 
monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could 
include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular 
business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results 
of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests 
of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Except as specifically 
described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.

European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the European Commission (EC) found that Intel had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy 
microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area 
Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required 
customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival 
products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in 
the third quarter of 2009. 
We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) 
rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to 
examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. 
In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against Intel regarding rebates, as well as the fine imposed on Intel, 
which was returned to us in February 2022. In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. A hearing 
date on the appeal has not been scheduled. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that Intel 
made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products, and in January 2023 the EC reopened its administrative procedure to 
determine a fine against Intel based on that alleged conduct. Given the procedural posture and the nature of this proceeding, we are 
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from this matter. 
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay Intel approximately 
€593 million in default interest, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 
decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly
referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings 
like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate 
software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly 
reported before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
Numerous lawsuits have been filed against Intel relating to Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of the security vulnerabilities that have 
been identified since 2018. As of January 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against Intel were pending in the United States, 
Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have 
been harmed by Intel's actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common law and 
statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the United States, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were 
consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in 
July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In 
Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a 
stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and 
responded to, a class action complaint in June 2022. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other 
related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given the procedural 
posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not 
been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if 
certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the 
potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters. 
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against Intel and certain 
officers following Intel’s July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs 
in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or 
otherwise acquired Intel common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants 
violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the 
court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, with leave to amend. Given the procedural posture and the nature 
of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the 
likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be 
resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In 
July 2021, Intel introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain 
of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial 
fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, 
or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could 
result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to 
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require 
that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse 
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as 
a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against Intel in the US District Court for the Northern District of California 
alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). 
Four patents remain at issue in the case, and VLSI estimates its damages to be approximately $900 million, and seeks enhanced 
damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. Intel filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent Trial and 
Appeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB's 
review. The PTAB subsequently found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district 
court lifted the stay in September 2021 and scheduled trial for March 2024 on the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB.
In June 2018, VLSI filed a second suit against Intel, in US District Court for the District of Delaware, seeking $4.4 billion in damages for 
the alleged infringement by various Intel processors of five additional patents that VLSI acquired from NXP. In December 2022, VLSI 
stipulated to dismiss with prejudice its claims, for which Intel paid nothing. The court dismissed the case in January 2023.
In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against Intel in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various 
Intel processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP. The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, 
and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the 
doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 
million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. Intel has appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including its 
claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. In December 2021 and January 2022, the PTAB instituted 
IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, but it has not yet issued a final written decision on either petition.
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that Intel does not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought 
approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final 
judgment following the second trial in Texas. The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining 
patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus a running royalty. 
The court has not yet entered final judgment following the third trial in Texas. In February 2023, Intel filed motions for a new trial and for 
judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) 
Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an 
invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), which held a hearing in 
September 2021. CNIPA has not yet issued a decision. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021 and stated that further trial 
proceedings were needed but would be stayed pending the outcome of defendants’ invalidity challenge at the CNIPA. VLSI seeks an 
injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. 
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., 
and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in 
December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. The court held a second trial hearing in May 
2022, but has yet to issue its final decision. In December 2022, Intel filed a second petition to invalidate the patent at issue.
Intel has accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to 
vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent 
developments and future proceedings.

Other Q12023
Q1 2023 results were impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with slowing consumer and enterprise demand, persistent 
inflation, and higher interest rates, that we believe impacts our target markets and creates a high level of uncertainty with our customers. 
We believe CCG, DCAI, and NEX customers, among others, tempered purchases to reduce their existing inventories and adjust to the 
macroeconomic uncertainty. We expect this macroeconomic uncertainty and the challenging market environment will continue during
2023.
Q1 2023 vs. Q1 2022
Our Q1 2023 revenue was $11.7 billion, down $6.6 billion or 36% from Q1 2022. CCG revenue decreased 38% from Q1 2022 due to 
lower notebook and desktop volumes on lower demand, while notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small core and older 
generation products. DCAI revenue decreased 39% from Q1 2022 due to lower server volume resulting from a softening data center 
market, partially offset by an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line. NEX revenue decreased 30% from Q1 2022, due to lower 
demand for Edge, Network Xeon, and Ethernet products. 
Incentives offered to certain customers to compete in the market, accelerate purchases, and to strategically position our products with 
customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $900 million to our revenue during the first 
quarter of 2023, the impacts of which were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q2 2023 as included in our Form 8-K dated April 27, 
2023.

Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. We 
estimate this change resulted in an approximate $360 million increase to gross margin, an approximate $100 million decrease in R&D 
expenses, and an approximate $525 million decrease in ending inventory values in Q1 2023 when compared to what the impact would 
have been using the estimated useful life in place prior to this change.
When compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by 
$4.1 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.3 billion increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D 
expenses, and a $1.4 billion decrease in ending inventory values.
Operating Expenses
Total R&D and MG&A expenses for Q1 2023 were $5.4 billion, down 11% from Q1 2022. These expenses represent 46.2% of revenue for 
Q1 2023 and 33.3% of revenue for Q1 2022. In support of our strategy, described in our 2022 Form 10-K, we continue to make significant 
investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires continued investments in R&D and focused efforts to attract and 
retain talent. We have implemented certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

pursuant to the 2022 Restructuring Program to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. We expect 
that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain of 
these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our 
strategy. 
Litigation charges and other includes a $1.2 billion benefit in Q1 2022 from the annulled penalty related to an EC fine that was recorded 
and paid in 2009.

Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments for Q1 2023 and Q1 2022 were primarily related to our interest in Montage Technology, Co. Ltd and 
others.
In Q1 2022, the sale of McAfee to an investor group was completed and we received $4.6 billion in cash for the sale of our remaining 
share of McAfee, recognizing a $4.6 billion gain in sale of equity investments and other.

In Q1 2023, we recognized a provision for taxes as we applied our estimated annual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of 
ordinary income (loss) before taxes, which reflects a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions. Our effective tax 
rate decreased in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, due to a loss before taxes, the application of our estimated annual effective tax rate, 
and the unfavorable tax rate effects associated with the gains recognized in Q1 2022 from the equity sale of McAfee and the divestiture of 
our NAND memory business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
(In Millions) Apr 1, 2023 Dec 31, 2022
Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,232 $ 11,144 
Short-term investments 19,302 17,194 
Loans receivable and other 64 463 
Total cash and investments1$ 27,598 $ 28,801 
Total debt $ 50,273 $ 42,051 
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash 
generated by operations, supplemented by our total cash and investments1, as shown in the preceding table, is our primary source of 
liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide 
manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and 
potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. This includes a commitment of $5.4 billion associated with our 
pending acquisition of Tower. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing 
expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and 
suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These 
actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash 
flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of 
our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the 
pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash 
requirements. 
In Q1 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to 
capital allocation, is expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us 
to create long-term value.
In Q1 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We intend to use the proceeds from the offering 
for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital 
expenditures. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility, extending the maturity date by one year to March 
2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources 
of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which 
we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing 
authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion and, as of April 1, 2023 we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper 
obligations outstanding. As of April 1, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our 
investments in debt instruments and financing receivables were in investment-grade securities.

Three Months Ended
(In Millions) Apr 1, 2023 Apr 2, 2022
Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities $ (1,785) $ 5,891 
Net cash used for investing activities (8,521) (2,639) 
Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities 7,394 (1,864) 
Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,912) $ 1,388 
Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
The decrease in cash provided by operations in the first three months of 2023 was primarily driven by our net operating loss in 
comparison to our net operating income for the first three months of 2022.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from 
divestitures. 
Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first three months of 2023 compared to the first three months of 2022, primarily due to 
the absence of proceeds from the divestiture of our NAND business and proceeds for our remaining share of McAfee, both of which 
occurred in the first three months of 2022; as well as higher capital expenditures in the first three months of 2023. These unfavorable cash 
impacts during the first three months of 2023 were partially offset by the favorable cash impacts of lower purchases of short-term 
investments, net of maturities and sales, during the first three months of 2023. 
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, 
and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.
Cash provided by financing activities in the first three months of 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in the first three 
months of 2022 was primarily due to net proceeds from our debt issuance, partially offset by commercial paper repayments, during the 
first three months of 2023.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial 
measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our 
operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of 
business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and 
measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax 
effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate across all adjustments. We project 
this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects 
of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various 
jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change 
for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or 
changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term 
operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides 
useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP results have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this 
updated approach.
These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in 
accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should 
be carefully evaluated.

MD&A 34

Acquisition-related 
adjustments
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets 
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as 
developed technology, brands, and customer 
relationships acquired in connection with business 
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of 
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales 
and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements. 
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated 
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and 
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisitionrelated intangible assets for purposes of calculating 
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges 
are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by 
the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These 
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current 
operating performance and comparison to our past 
operating performance and provide investors with 
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Share-based 
compensation
Share-based compensation consists of charges related 
to our employee equity incentive plans.
We exclude charges related to share-based 
compensation for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because we believe these adjustments 
provide better comparability to peer company results 
and because these charges are not viewed by 
management as part of our core operating performance. 
We believe these adjustments provide investors with a 
useful view, through the eyes of management, of our 
core business model, how management currently 
evaluates core operational performance, and additional 
means to evaluate expense trends, including in 
comparison to other peer companies.
Restructuring and 
other charges
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a 
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to 
employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other 
charges may include periodic goodwill and asset 
impairments, certain pension charges, and costs 
associated with restructuring activity, and in Q1 2022 
includes a benefit related to the annulled EC fine.
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including 
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because these costs do not reflect our core operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our core operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results and provide 
investors with additional means to evaluate expense 
trends.
Gains (losses) from 
divestiture
Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a 
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when 
deferred consideration is received at the time of closing. 
Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer 
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in 
connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND 
memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of 
the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be 
recognized between first and second closing.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures 
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because they do not reflect our current operating 
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful 
evaluation of our current operating performance and 
comparisons to past operating results.
(Gains) losses on 
equity investments, 
net
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of 
ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable 
equity securities, observable price adjustments on nonmarketable equity securities, related impairment 
charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.
We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for 
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures 
because it provides better comparability between 
periods. The exclusion reflects how management 
evaluates the core operations of the business.
Adjusted free cash 
flow
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of 
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management 
when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital 
resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash 
flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to 
property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from 
capital grants and partner contributions, (2) payments 
on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee 
equity sale.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in 
understanding our capital requirements and sources of 
liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate 
the cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017 
divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales 
contributed to prior operating and free cash flow, and 
while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have 
typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as 
an equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in 
adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more 
consistent comparison to past presentations of liquidity.
Total cash and 
investments
Total cash and investments is used by management 
when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include 
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and 
loans receivable and other.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our 
capital resources and liquidity position.

Other Key Information
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management 
programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and 
sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to 
"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our 
business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not 
identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently 
consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a 
reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also 
to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and Consolidated Condensed 
Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and 
procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how 
well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The 
design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered 
relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute 
assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been 
detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of 
the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls 
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange 
Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit 
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and 
is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, 
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange 
Act) that occurred during the quarter ended April 1, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our 
internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase 
shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending April 1, 
2023. As of April 1, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common 
stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock 
repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common 
stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates 
knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions 
during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 
2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one 
such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in 
order to conduct business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US 
Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated 
with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all business operations in Russia until further 
notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by 
applicable law.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security 
firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive 
Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a 
license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such 
activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
