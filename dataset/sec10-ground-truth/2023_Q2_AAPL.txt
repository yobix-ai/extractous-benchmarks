Apple Inc.
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)
Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Preparation
The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”).
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s management, the condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022.
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal
years 2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022

Diluted earnings per share $ 1.52 $ 1.52 $ 3.41 $ 3.62
Approximately 48 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the six months ended April 1, 2023
because their effect would have been antidilutive.

2022, $3.0 billion of revenue recognized in the three months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of December 25, 2021, $5.5 billion
of revenue recognized in the six months ended April 1, 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $4.8 billion of revenue
recognized in the six months ended March 26, 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 10, “Segment
Information and Geographic Data” for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue
represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
As of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.5 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of April 1, 2023, the
Company expects 65% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 26% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 2% in greater
than three years.

Due after 10 years 17,181
Total fair value $ 110,461
Derivative Instruments and Hedging
The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or
interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.
To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company
may enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value
hedges. As of April 1, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–
related foreign currency transactions is 19 years.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.
Interest Rate Risk
To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):

(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from
contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective
counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party
to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.

Accounts Receivable
Trade Receivables
The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit
risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These creditfinancing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.
As of both April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for
10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 32% and 44% of total trade receivables as of April 1, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.
Vendor Non-Trade Receivables
The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. As of April 1, 2023, the
Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 43%, 19% and 13%. As of
September 24, 2022, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54%
and 13%.

Note 5 – Income Taxes
European Commission State Aid Decision
On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and
2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered
Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of
January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General
Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September
25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice and a hearing has been scheduled for May 23,
2023. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due
related to the State Aid Decision.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on
certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding
the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,”
“can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly
from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I,
Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 (the “2022 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.”
The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or
periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the
“Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website,
investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance
matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not
incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday
demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product
introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product
launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers
and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter
every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years
2023 and 2022 span 53 and 52 weeks, respectively.
Quarterly Highlights
Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on the Company’s total net sales, which decreased 3% or $2.4 billion during
the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The year-over-year net sales decrease consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac, partially
offset by higher net sales of Services.
During the second quarter of 2023, the Company announced the following new products:
• MacBook Pro 14” and MacBook Pro 16”, powered by the Apple M2 Pro and M2 Max chip;
• Mac mini , powered by the Apple M2 and M2 Pro chip; and
• Second-generation HomePod .
The Company repurchased $19.1 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.7 billion during the second quarter of 2023.

Selling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat during the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same periods in 2022.
Provision for Income Taxes
Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2023 and March 26, 2022
were as follows (dollars in millions):
Three Months Ended Six Months Ended
April 1,
2023
March 26,
2022
April 1,
2023
March 26,
2022
Provision for income taxes $ 4,222 $ 5,129 $ 9,847 $ 11,740
Effective tax rate 14.9 % 17.0 % 15.4 % 16.4 %
Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % 21 %
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on
foreign earnings and the U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2023 was
lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the U.S. federal R&D credit and tax benefits from
share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was lower compared to the second quarter of 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign
tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first
six months of 2023 was lower compared to the same period in 2022 due primarily to the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury in 2022 and a higher U.S. federal R&D credit, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and
continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2022 Form 10-K, except for commercial paper and manufacturing
purchase obligations.
Apple Inc. | Q2 2023 Form 10-Q | 18

Commercial Paper
The Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (“Commercial Paper”) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of April 1, 2023, the Company
had $2.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire
components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of April 1, 2023, the
Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.5 billion, with $40.1 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase
obligations are primarily noncancelable.
Capital Return Program
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program, under which the remaining availability was $22.6
billion as of April 1, 2023. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the Board of Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion
of the Company’s common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.
On May 4, 2023, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share, beginning
with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2023. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the
Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion
and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2022 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and
methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s
critical accounting estimates since the 2022 Form 10-K.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first six months of 2023. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market
risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2022 Form
10-K.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal
financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) were effective as of April 1, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with
management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
Epic Games
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern California District Court”) against the
Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store .
The Company filed a counterclaim for breach of contract. On September 10, 2021, the Northern California District Court ruled in favor of the Company with
respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim, and in favor of the Company with respect to the Company’s claims for breach of contract. The
Northern California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and
issued an injunction. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the Northern California District Court’s ruling. The Company is
considering further review of the decision.
Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The
Company settled certain matters during the second quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a
reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be
materially adversely affected.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known
or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2022 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks
materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely
affected. There have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2022 Form 10-K.
Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

(1) On April 28, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of an additional $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase
program. As of April 1, 2023, total utilization under the April 2022 authorization was $67.4 billion. On May 4, 2023, the Company announced the Board of
Directors had authorized an additional program to repurchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock. The programs do not obligate the Company to
acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under
plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
