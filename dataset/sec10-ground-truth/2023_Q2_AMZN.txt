NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)
Note 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and, in our opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and accruals necessary for a fair presentation of our consolidated cash flows, operating results, and balance sheets for the periods
presented. Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for 2023 due to seasonal and other
factors. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. These consolidated financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other operating expense (income), net” was
reclassified into “Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized content costs, operating lease assets, and other” on our consolidated
statements of cash flows.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of
its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in
India and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between
consolidated entities are eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates
are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stockbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating
leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ
materially from these estimates.
For the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $510 million of estimated severance costs primarily related to planned role
eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in “Sales and marketing,” “Technology and infrastructure,” and “General and administrative” on our
consolidated statements of operations and included approximately $320 million recorded within our AWS segment.
For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, we recorded approximately $260 million and $250 million of impairments of property and equipment
and operating leases primarily related to physical stores in 2022 and fulfillment network facilities in 2023. These charges were recorded in “Other operating
expense (income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the six months ended June 30,
2022 and 2023, we also recorded expenses of approximately $230 million and $180 million primarily in “Fulfillment” in 2022 and “Cost of sales” and
“Fulfillment” in 2023, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to terminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as
other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our
weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we
have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.

Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(3.9) billion and $187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023,
and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our
investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial
public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock to Class A common stock. As of June 30, 2023, we held 158 million
shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 17% ownership interest, and an approximate 16% voting interest. We determined that
we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our equity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric
vehicles, and one of our employees serving on Rivian’s
8

Table of Contents
board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on our
consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The investment was subject to
regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired in Q1
2022.
Required summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions):
Three Months Ended March 31,
2022 2023
Revenues $ 95 $ 661
Gross profit (502) (535)
Loss from operations (1,579) (1,433)
Net loss (1,593) (1,349)
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such
as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The
inventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Other
Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers,
as well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, customer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and $25.3
billion, vendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $5.6 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion, and other receivables, net, were
$3.1 billion and $2.7 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily
to procure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
$1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
Digital Video and Music Content
The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023 were $16.7 billion and
$17.8 billion. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.6 years. Total video and music expense was $3.7 billion and $4.4
billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $7.3 billion and $8.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service
period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31,
2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $8.6 billion was recognized as revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Included in “Other long-term liabilities”
on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.
Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that
have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet
recognized were $132.1 billion as of June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.6 years. However, the amount and
timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.
Acquisition Activity
On February 22, 2023, we acquired 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (“One Medical”), for cash consideration of approximately $3.5 billion, net of cash acquired, to
provide health care options for customers. The acquired assets primarily consist of $1.3 billion
9

Table of Contents
of intangible assets and $2.5 billion of goodwill, which is allocated to our North America segment. The valuation of certain assets and liabilities is preliminary
and subject to change.
Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of the One Medical acquisition were not material to our consolidated results
of operations. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.
Note 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAArated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities. Cash
equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following
hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:
Level 1—Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2—Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3—Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other
market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
We measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar
instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities
categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

(1) Includes non-cancellable financing obligations for fulfillment network and data center facilities. Excluding interest, current financing obligations of $266
million and $269 million are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” and $6.7 billion and $6.6 billion are recorded within “Other long-term
liabilities” as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.5 years

(2) Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the
consolidated balance sheets and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. For those digital media content agreements with variable
terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with
renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.
(3) Includes asset retirement obligations, liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year, and the estimated
timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction.
(4) Excludes approximately $5.0 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of
payment, if any.

Table of Contents
In August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt,
subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to fund this acquisition with cash on hand.
Other Contingencies
We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as
sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax
controversies typically relate to (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on
transactions with third parties, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the
inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such
controversies may be materially different from our expectations.
Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in
Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended March 31, 2023, as supplemented by the following:
In December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Illinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, both entitled
“Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and 7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network
Separate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’
fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and
Trademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted. In July 2023, Kove alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon
Web Services could be subject to $517 million to $1.03 billion in damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously
in this matter.
In May 2023, Dialect, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District for Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon’s Alexa-enabled products and services, such as Echo devices, Fire
tablets, Fire TV sticks, Fire TVs, Alexa, and Alexa Voice Services, infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,693,720 and 9,031,845, each entitled “Mobile Systems and
Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance”; 8,015,006, entitled “Systems and Methods for Processing Natural Language Speech
Utterances with Context-Specific Domain Agents”; 8,140,327, entitled “System and Method for Filtering and Eliminating Noise from Natural Language
Utterances to Improve Speech Recognition and Parsing”; 8,195,468 and 9,495,957, each entitled “Mobile Systems and Methods of Supporting Natural
Language Human-Machine Interactions”; and 9,263,039, entitled “Systems and Methods for Responding to Natural Language Speech Utterance.” The
complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of
wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other
intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes,
goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to
our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that
could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and
changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such
an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the
application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been
incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.

(1) The weighted-average remaining lives of the 2014, 2017, 2020, 2021, April 2022, and December 2022 Notes were 12.1, 14.6, 18.1, 13.6, 12.8, and 5.4
years as of June 30, 2023. The combined weighted-average remaining life of the Notes was 13.2 years as of June 30, 2023.
Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified
redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $61.4 billion and
$59.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.
In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), which matures in January
2024 and bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%. If we exercise our option to extend the Term Loan’s
maturity to January 2025, the interest rate spread will increase from 0.75% to 1.05%. As of June 30, 2023, $8.0 billion of the Term Loan was outstanding,
which was included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had an interest rate of 5.9%.
We have a $1.5 billion secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we may from time to time
increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until August 2025, bears interest based on the daily
Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and has a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion. There were $1.0 billion and $972 million of
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which had an interest rate of 5.6% and 6.3%, respectively. As of
December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, we have pledged $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our
Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 and
June 30, 2023.
We have U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper programs (the “Commercial Paper Programs”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured
commercial paper up to a total of $20.0 billion (including up to €3.0 billion) at the date of issue, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed
397 days from the date of issue. There were $6.8 billion and $4.4 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31,
2022 and June 30, 2023, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets and had a weighted-average effective
interest rate, including issuance costs, of 4.5% and 5.0%, respectively. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate
purposes.
We have a $10.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), with a term that extends to March 2025.
It may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit
Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the
credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

Table of Contents
We have a $10.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which matures in
November 2023 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances
under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a
commitment fee of 0.05% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2022
and June 30, 2023.
We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of borrowings outstanding under
these facilities as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In
addition, we had $7.5 billion of unused letters of credit as of June 30, 2023.
Note 6 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Stock Repurchase Activity
In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration, which
replaced the previous $5.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, approved by the Board of Directors in February 2016. We repurchased 46.2 million shares of
our common stock for $6.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2022 under these programs. There were no repurchases of our common stock during
the six months ended June 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2023, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.
Stock Award Activity
Common shares outstanding plus shares underlying outstanding stock awards totaled 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30,
2023. These totals include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, including those awards we estimate will be forfeited. Stock-based compensation

As of June 30, 2023, there was $28.0 billion of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation arrangements. This
compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with more than half of the compensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a
remaining weighted-average recognition period of 1.0 year. The estimated forfeiture rate as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023 was 26.5% and 26.3%.
Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.

Note 7 — INCOME TAXES
Our tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete
items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate
changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
Our quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including
variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the
applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, developments in tax controversies, changes in our stock price,
changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and
accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our effective tax rate can be
more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax
rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our
ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.
For 2023, we estimate that our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted by the foreign income deduction and U.S. federal research and development
credit and adversely affected by state income taxes. In addition, valuation gains and losses from our equity investment in Rivian impact our pre-tax income and
may cause variability in our effective tax rate.
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily
attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,
which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits, consisting of $805 million resulting from a change in the estimated qualifying expenditures associated
with our 2022 U.S.

federal R&D credit and a related increase in our foreign income deduction tax benefit, partially offset by discrete tax expense related to shortfalls from stockbased compensation.
Cash paid for income taxes, net of refunds was $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $3.6 billion and $4.4 billion for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, tax contingencies were approximately $4.0 billion and $5.0 billion. Changes in tax laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and
uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly
uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is
reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income
tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years’
tax filings.
We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These
examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination
as well as subsequent periods.
We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the
United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular
jurisdictions primarily for 2011 and thereafter. We are currently disputing tax assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including with respect to the allocation and
characterization of income.
In September 2022, the Luxembourg tax authority (“LTA”) denied the tax basis of certain intangible assets that we distributed from Luxembourg to the
U.S. in 2021. We believe the LTA’s position is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
In February 2023, we received a decision by the Indian tax authority (“ITA”) that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We will
need to remit taxes on the services in question, including for a portion of prior years, until this matter is resolved, which payments could be significant in the
aggregate. We believe the ITA’s decision is without merit, we are defending our position vigorously in the Indian courts, and we expect to recoup taxes paid. If
this matter is adversely resolved, we could recognize significant additional tax expense, including for taxes previously paid.
In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with
regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European
Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on
that decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006
through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an
initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending
conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the
European Union General Court annulled the European Commission’s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the
European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
Note 8 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses
“Fulfillment,” “Technology and infrastructure,” “Sales and marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the
segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are incurred in the U.S. and are included
in our North America and AWS segments. The majority of infrastructure costs recorded in “Technology and infrastructure” are allocated to the AWS segment
based on usage. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision
maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations.
North America
The North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and
subscription services through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.
18

Table of Contents
International
The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and advertising and
subscription services through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores
(including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused
online stores.
AWS
The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government
agencies, and academic institutions.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All
statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial
position, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar
expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results and outcomes could dif er materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global
economic conditions and customer demand and spending, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the
Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix
of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other
taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation,
government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, variability in
demand, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions,
payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, global economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen
circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties
that could cause our actual results or outcomes to dif er significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part II,
“Risk Factors.”
For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Overview” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical
accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are
reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the
critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that
are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —
Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial
Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and
judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different
assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Inventories
Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost
and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such
as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These
assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material writedowns in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of June 30, 2023, we would have recorded an
additional cost of sales of approximately $385 million.
In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on
forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,
principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other
conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur
during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to
21

Table of Contents
change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.
Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new
businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in
jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in
jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our
stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and
their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax
framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing
changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.
We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.
Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for
which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these
proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations,
and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Financing activities 4,626 (6,539) 6,616 (185) 740 2,917
Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at
fair value, were $70.0 billion and $64.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $14.8
billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupee, and
Japanese Yen.
Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $9.0 billion and $16.5 billion for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $6.2 billion and $21.3 billion for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and
content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and
related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales.
The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to changes in
net income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables,
including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment
terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from
property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and
purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(12.1) billion and $(9.7) billion for Q2 2022 and
Q2 2023, and $(11.2) billion and $(25.5) billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and
maturities of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $14.1 billion and $10.4 billion during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $27.8 billion and $23.5
billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support
AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network. We expect cash capital expenditures to decrease in 2023, primarily due to
lower spending on our fulfillment network. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $259 million
and $316 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $6.6 billion and $3.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions
of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and One Medical in 2023 with cash on hand. We expect to fund the acquisition of iRobot Corporation with cash on hand.

Table of Contents
Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $4.6 billion and $(6.5) billion for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $6.6 billion and $(185) million for the
six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of
$17.7 billion and $4.4 billion for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $31.4 billion and $17.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows
from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and
financing obligations of $13.1 billion and $10.9 billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $24.8 billion and $17.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022
and 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $61 million and $240 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $227 million and $248
million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023.
We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities, $4.4 billion of borrowings outstanding under the commercial
paper programs, $972 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility, and $8.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan as of
June 30, 2023. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information.
Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in
the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the
U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.
Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development
expenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily
equipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and
development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. As a result, we
expect the cash taxes we pay in 2023 to increase significantly. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $3.1 billion and $3.7 billion for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and
$3.6 billion and $4.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023.
As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and $538 million. See Item 1
of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies” and “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional discussion of our
principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory
and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders
are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.
We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing
arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs
and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or
debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay
dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.
The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the
acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity
requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or
financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies
are contributing to rising interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future
borrowing costs.

Results of Operations
We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates
its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 8 — Segment Information.”
Overview
Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and
geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel,
utility, and food costs, rising interest rates, and recessionary fears may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also
expect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or
all of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q3 2023.
Net Sales
Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content
where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping
fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in

Sales increased 11% in Q2 2023, and 10% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods. Changes in foreign
exchange rates reduced net sales by $285 million for Q2 2023, and by $2.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. For a discussion of the effect of
foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.
North America sales increased 11% in Q2 2023, and 11% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The
sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services. Increased unit sales were
driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our shipping offers.

Table of Contents
International sales increased 10% in Q2 2023, and 5% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods, primarily
due to increased unit sales, primarily by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and subscription services, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign
exchange rates. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued focus on price, selection, and convenience for our customers, including from our
shipping offers. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced International net sales by $180 million for Q2 2023, and by $2.4 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2023.
AWS sales increased 12% in Q2 2023, and 14% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the comparable prior year periods. The sales growth
primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes, primarily driven by long-term customer contracts.

Consolidated $ 3,317 $ 7,681 $ 6,986 $ 12,455
Operating income increased from $3.3 billion in Q2 2022 to $7.7 billion in Q2 2023, and increased from $7.0 billion for the six months ended June 30,
2022 to $12.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023. We believe that operating income is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross
margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.
The North America operating income in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the operating loss in the comparable prior
year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased technology and infrastructure costs, increased
shipping and fulfillment costs, and growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates negatively impacted operating income by $7
million for Q2 2023, and positively impacted operating income by $34 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.
The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior
year periods, is primarily due to increased unit sales and increased advertising sales, partially offset by increased fulfillment and shipping costs, increased
technology and infrastructure costs, and growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating loss by
$32 million for Q2 2023, and negatively impacted operating loss by $142 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.
The decrease in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior
year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses and spending on technology infrastructure, both of which were primarily driven by
additional investments to support AWS business growth, partially offset by increased sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates positively impacted operating
income by $79 million for Q2 2023, and by $351 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

Cost of Sales
Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and
delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and
music.
The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year periods,
is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign
exchange rates reduced cost of sales by $208 million for Q2 2023, and by $1.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2023.
Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our
customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $19.3 billion and $20.5 billion in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023,
and $38.9 billion and $40.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our
customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to
mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our
suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way
we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.
Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both
our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical
stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing
26

Table of Contents
and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a
percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy,
changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of
fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our
ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features.
Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because
payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.
The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior year
periods, is primarily due to increased sales, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced fulfillment costs by
$35 million for Q2 2023, and by $431 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.
We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes
from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.
Technology and Infrastructure
Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing
products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores,
and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and
other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide
variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and
electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.
We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve
our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and
capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and
operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are
allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30,
2023, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for
expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings, and an increase in spending on infrastructure.
Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $95 million for Q2 2023, and by $399 million for the six months ended June
30, 2023. See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview” of our 2022 Annual
Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales
commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and
online advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales
and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we
would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.
The increase in sales and marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable prior
year periods, is primarily due to increased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.
While costs associated with Amazon Prime membership benefits and other shipping offers are not included in sales and marketing expense, we view
these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.
General and Administrative
The increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2023 and for the six months ended June 30, 2023, compared to the comparable
prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses.

Other Operating Expense (Income), Net
Other operating expense (income), net was $90 million and $146 million for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $339 million and $369 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to asset impairments for physical store closures in 2022 and for fulfillment network facilities
in 2023, and the amortization of intangible assets.
Interest Income and Expense
Our interest income was $159 million and $661 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $267 million and $1.3 billion for the six months ended June
30, 2022 and 2023, primarily due to an increase in prevailing rates. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment
grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the
prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.
Interest expense was $584 million and $840 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $1.1 billion and $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30,
2022 and 2023, and was primarily related to debt and finance leases. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 3 — Leases and Note 5 — Debt” for
additional information.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was $(5.5) billion and $61 million during Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(14.1) billion and $(382) million for the six months
ended June 30, 2022 and 2023. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities valuations and adjustments, equity
warrant valuations, and foreign currency. Included in other income (expense), net is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(3.9) billion and
$187 million in Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, and $(11.5) billion and $(280) million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023, from our equity investment in
Rivian.
Income Taxes
Our income tax benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2022 was $2.1 billion, which included $3.2 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily
attributable to a valuation loss related to our equity investment in Rivian. Our income tax provision for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $1.8 billion,
which included $306 million of net discrete tax benefits. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 7 — Income Taxes” for additional information.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain
non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet
the definition of non-GAAP financial measures.
We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property
and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following
is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing
twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):

Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance
leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual
payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance
leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve
months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in millions):

Free Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations
Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by
equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and
modifications,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal
repayments of financing obligations.” All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired
under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a
reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 (in
millions):

All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the
residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments
representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or
other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire
consolidated statements of cash flows.
Ef ect of Foreign Exchange Rates
Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided
to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on
our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):

Guidance
We provided guidance on August 3, 2023, in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K as set forth below. These forward-looking statements reflect
Amazon.com’s expectations as of August 3, 2023, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially
affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and
spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet,
online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.”
Third Quarter 2023 Guidance
• Net sales are expected to be between $138.0 billion and $143.0 billion, or to grow between 9% and 13% compared with third quarter 2022. This
guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 120 basis points from foreign exchange rates.
• Operating income is expected to be between $5.5 billion and $8.5 billion, compared with $2.5 billion in third quarter 2022.
• This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments.
Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Interest Rate Risk
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at
amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays
interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of
increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term
marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates,
and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.
Foreign Exchange Risk
During Q2 2023, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated
from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated
in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain
of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon
consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains
or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to
rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q2 2023 decreased by $180 million in comparison with Q2 2022.
We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance
of foreign funds as of June 30, 2023, of $14.8 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $740
million, $1.5 billion, and $3.0 billion.
We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of
June 30, 2023, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $245 million, $490 million, and $985 million,
recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”
See Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of
Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Equity Investment Risk
As of June 30, 2023, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $6.8 billion. Our equity and equity
warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.5 billion of our investments as of June 30, 2023,
and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust
our equity investments in private companies for observable price changes or impairments. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to
the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities
are not practicable.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
During the most recent fiscal quarter, there has not occurred any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does
not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed
and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
the Company have been detected.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings
See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings.”
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Please carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The
events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a
material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results),
cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or
uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors
discussed in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, global
economic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks
discussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse
effect on us.
Business and Industry Risks
We Face Intense Competition
Our businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition,
and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services,
electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater
resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer
geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,
fulfillment, and marketing.
Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as
our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our
business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial
intelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and
comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and
service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of
which could materially reduce our sales and profits.
Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks
We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,
which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by,
service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we
may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the
benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In
addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new
technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.
Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks
Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market
segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,
develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a
sustained basis.

Table of Contents
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:
• local economic and political conditions;
• government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade
protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;
• restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including
uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices
regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;
• business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;
• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;
• limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;
• shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;
• laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments,
advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;
• lower levels of use of the Internet;
• lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;
• lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;
• difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;
• different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;
• compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government
officials and other third parties;
• laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and
• geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.
As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through
adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on,
the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit
our international growth.
The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and
license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors,
(ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and
cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to
provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail
trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver
to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these
structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional
changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the
interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our
Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China,
enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in
the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having
licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.
The Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations
Demand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or
unforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary
35

Table of Contents
fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or
geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock
popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we
overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce
profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments
necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand,
we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of
goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and
customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the
seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high
demand.
As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest
level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores
and the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases
and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting
in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.
We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers
The law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the
future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from
collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different
from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling
goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are
circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful
activities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party
seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.
We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third
Parties
We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as
critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our
employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our
products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.
Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties
from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.
We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license
our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the
expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect
our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently
develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.
We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual
property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial
and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses
from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been
amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.

Table of Contents
Our digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or
malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their
content in our service.
We Have Foreign Exchange Risk
The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are
exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record
significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate
fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros,
and Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may
be materially less than expected and vice versa.
Operating Risks
Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources
We are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our
infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,
personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases
these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate
We are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion
of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.
Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the
continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic, business, and
geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global
economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.
Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:
• our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;
• our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;
• our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;
• the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;
• changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;
• timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;
• the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;
• the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;
• the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material
adverse impact on our operating results;
• variations in the mix of products and services we sell;
• variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
• the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;
• factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to
sustainability, customers, employees, or other topics);
37

Table of Contents
• the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;
• increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), energy products, commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products, and
technology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures;
• constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;
• the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and
unconstrained access to our online services;
• our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;
• the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or
otherwise tailor our product and service offerings;
• the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer
intrusions, outages, and similar events; and
• disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change),
geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes (including restrictive governmental
actions impacting us and our third-party sellers in China or other foreign countries), and similar events.
We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers
Failures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data
centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment
charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different
requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance
that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.
In addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance
products are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment
network and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase
payroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.
Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and
operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory
fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment
network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.
We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable
terms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation
systems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition,
our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused
disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade
disputes, and similar events.
We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches
Because we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal
information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’
technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information; adversely affect our operating
results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data security, network security, and
consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use thirdparty technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content
delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have
a material adverse
38

Table of Contents
effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse effects on our operations or financial results.
Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes
designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate
as intended or be circumvented.
We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy
We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from
efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our
products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of
our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.
Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as
natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security
issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy
shortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from
accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability.
Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to
compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.
The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Af ect Our
Business
We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies.
We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has
historically been intense. For example, we experience significant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer
scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we make to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our
employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified
personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain,
and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.
We also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure
to successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our
business and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase
our payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.
We are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our
operational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived
negatively and harm our business and reputation.
Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks
We have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to
our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our
suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by
our current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including
as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health
crises), or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable
terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms, intellectual property rights of others,
or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation,
limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.
39

Table of Contents
Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks
We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic
alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services,
as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity,
personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop
the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection,
payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under
certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not
successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into
additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we
provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.
As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into
amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our
operating results.
Our present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:
• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
• impairment of other relationships;
• variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and
• difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.
Our Business Suf ers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments
We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional
companies. These transactions involve risks such as:
• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
• problems retaining key personnel;
• additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;
• the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;
• the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of
any integration of operations;
• the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving
anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;
• the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;
• the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other
administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;
• losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our
financial results;
• for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for
which we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting,
and similar systems, controls, and processes;
• the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;
• the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;
• potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and
40

Table of Contents
• for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political,
and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or
amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms,
if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have
experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.
We Face Significant Inventory Risk
In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed
to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles
and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products,
spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.
Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we
begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and
accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be
returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell
products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely
affect our operating results.
We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks
We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct
debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer
to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to
implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For
certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and
lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of
credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or
unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less
favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and
rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with
these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems,
could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card
payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be
adversely affected.
In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to
third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing,
regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or
processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money
laundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and
electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and
criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.
We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile
We have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks
described elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:
• changes in interest rates;
• conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;
• quarterly variations in operating results;
41

Table of Contents
• fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;
• changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;
• changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;
• changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;
• changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and
• transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.
Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees
or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders,
or both.
Legal and Regulatory Risks
Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business
We are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and
omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and
services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,
consumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy
consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web
services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our
services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of
products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws
governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and consumer protection
apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and artificial intelligence
technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and
expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings by
governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations.
For example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations violate competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s
U.S. and European marketplace for sellers, particularly with respect to use of data, fulfillment services, and featured offers, and legislative and regulatory
initiatives in Europe and elsewhere allow authorities to restrict or prohibit certain operations or actions pre-emptively without the need to assess specific
competitive effects. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and regulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data,
the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators will view our privacy practices. Unfavorable regulations, laws,
decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions
threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including
substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our
business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our
operations. The media, political, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.
Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Af ect Our Business and Results of Operations
As an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and
threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide
range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data
protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties,
and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our
products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek
to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For example, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection
claims, including those brought by state attorneys general. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption
of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are

inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may
not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the
amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a
material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more
such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future
payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our
business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect
on our operations.
We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture
Some of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or
environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us
to product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in
these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we
maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be
available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of
products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our
vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.
We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations
We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize
additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,
administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and
accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of
jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online
commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes
on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions
have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue
unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us
prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide
information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not
have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.
Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new
businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to
realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to
our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is
required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.
We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or
other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for
prior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial,
administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations.
For example, in February 2023, the Indian tax authority determined that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this
determination; however, if this matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our
taxes in the future could increase. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our
tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be
materially different from our historical tax accruals.

We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations
Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements
relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any
violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of
payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are
subject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.
