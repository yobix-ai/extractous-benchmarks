A Quarter in Review
Total revenue of $14.2 billion was down $1.2 billion or 8% from Q3 2022, as CCG revenue decreased 3%, DCAI revenue decreased 10%, and NEX revenue decreased 32%.
CCG revenue decreased due to lower desktop volume from lower demand across business market segments and lower notebook ASPs due to a higher mix of small core
products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. This was partially offset by higher notebook volume, as customer inventory levels began to normalize and
higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased due to lower server volume resulting
from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products.
NEX revenue decreased as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.

Key Developments
▪ Our Ireland fab began high-volume production of Intel 4 technology. This is the first use of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in high-volume manufacturing in Europe.
▪ We announced our upcoming Intel® Core™ Ultra processors, featuring our first integrated neural processing unit, for power-efficient AI acceleration and local inference on
the PC, which is expected to launch in Q4 2023.
▪ We mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during the first quarter of 2022 to acquire Tower, due to our inability to obtain regulatory approval
in a timely manner.
▪ We announced a commercial agreement with Tower, where we will provide foundry services and manufacturing capacity through our New Mexico facility for 300mm
advanced analog processing.
▪ We received a $600 million grant from the State of Ohio to support the ongoing construction of our two chip factories in the state.

Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements
Note 1 : Basis of Presentation
We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those
applied in our 2022 Form 10-K.
We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal year 2023 is a 52-week fiscal year; fiscal 2022 was a 53-week fiscal year, with the extra
week included in the first quarter of 2022.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results
that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary
to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2022 Form 10-
K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
Note 2 : Operating Segments
We previously announced the organizational change to integrate AXG into CCG and DCAI. This change is intended to drive a more effective go-to-market capability and to
accelerate the scale of these businesses, while also reducing costs. As a result, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2023 to align to this and certain other
business reorganizations. All prior-period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors
our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2023.
We manage our business through the following operating segments:
▪ Client Computing (CCG)
▪ Data Center and AI (DCAI)
▪ Network and Edge (NEX)
▪ Mobileye
▪ Intel Foundry Services (IFS)
We derive a substantial majority of our revenue from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a
stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which is based on Intel architecture.
CCG, DCAI and NEX are our reportable operating segments. Mobileye and IFS do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose the
results of these non-reportable operating segments. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.
We have sales and marketing, manufacturing, engineering, finance, and administration groups. Expenses for these groups are generally allocated to the operating segments.
We have an "all other" category that includes revenue, expenses, and charges such as:
▪ results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives;
▪ historical results of operations from divested businesses;
▪ amounts included within restructuring and other charges;
▪ employee benefits, compensation, impairment charges, and other expenses not allocated to the operating segments; and
▪ acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and
operating income (loss). The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information, and we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segments.
Based on the interchangeable nature of our manufacturing and assembly and test assets, most of the related depreciation expense is not directly identifiable within our operating
segments, as it is included in overhead cost pools and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process. Because our products
are then sold across multiple operating segments, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each operating segment's operating
income (loss) results. We do not allocate gains and losses from equity investments, interest and other income, share-based compensation, or taxes to our operating segments.
Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The accounting policies for
segment reporting are the same as for Intel as a whole. There have been no changes to our segment accounting policies disclosed in our 2022 Form 10-K except for the
organizational change described above.

In the second quarter of 2022, we initiated the wind-down of our Intel® Optane™ memory business, which is part of our DCAI operating segment, resulting in an inventory
impairment of $559 million in Cost of sales on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income in the first nine months of 2022. The impairment charge was recognized as a
Corporate charge in the "all other" category presented above.
Note 3 : Non-Controlling Interests
Semiconductor Co-Investment Program
In 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab), a VIE for which we and Brookfield
own 51% and 49%, respectively. Because we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we fully consolidate the results of Arizona Fab into our consolidated financial statements.
Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from, Arizona Fab based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be sole operator and majority
owner of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences,
we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will
be subject to certain penalties.
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of $29.0 billion.
As of September 30, 2023, a substantial majority of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The assets held by Arizona Fab, which can be used
only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $4.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 ($1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022).
Non-controlling interest in Arizona Fab was $2.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 ($874 million as of December 31, 2022). Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest in
Arizona Fab was $3 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $12 million in the first nine months of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in
the first nine months of 2022.
Mobileye
In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions that resulted in net proceeds of $1.0 billion. During the second quarter of 2023, we converted
$38.5 million of Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of Mobileye’s outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $42 per share as part
of a secondary offering. We received net proceeds of $1.6 billion and increased our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax, as a result of the secondary offering.
We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements.
Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements 10

Table of Contents
As of September 30, 2023, Intel held approximately 88% (94% as of December 31, 2022) of the outstanding equity interest in Mobileye. Non-controlling interest in Mobileye was
$1.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 ($1.0 billion as of December 31, 2022). Net income attributable to non-controlling interest in Mobileye was $6 million in the third quarter of
2023 and $3 million of net loss in the first nine months of 2023; there was no net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest in the first nine months of 2022.
IMS Nanofabrication
In August 2023, we closed an agreement to sell a 20% minority stake in our IMS Nanofabrication GmbH (IMS) business, a business within our IFS operating segment, to Bain
Capital Special Situations (Bain Capital). Net proceeds resulting from the sale were $849 million and our capital in excess of par value increased by $591 million, net of tax. We
continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.
Non-controlling interest in IMS was $109 million as of September 30, 2023. Net income attributable to the non-controlling interest in IMS was $10 million in the third quarter of
2023 and in the first nine months of 2023.
In September 2023, we signed agreements to sell an additional 12.5% minority stake in our IMS business, including 10% to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd.
(TSMC), which are expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023.
Note 4 : Earnings (Loss) Per Share
We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed
diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common
stock outstanding during the period.

Earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel—diluted $ 0.07 $ 0.25 $ (0.23) $ 2.10
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding
stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. Securities that were anti-dilutive were
insignificant and were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in all periods presented.
Due to our net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the
assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share for the period and were excluded.
Note 5 : Other Financial Statement Details
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash
proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring
arrangements were $1.5 billion during the first nine months of 2023. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the
third-party financial institution.

Property, Plant, and Equipment
Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. We estimate this change resulted in an
approximate $690 million increase to gross margin and an approximate $110 million decrease in R&D expense in the third quarter of 2023 when compared to what the impact
would have been using the estimated useful life in place prior to this change. We estimate this change resulted in an approximate $1.6 billion increase to gross margin and an
approximate $320 million decrease in R&D expenses in the first nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we estimate this change resulted in an approximate $1.2 billion
decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and under construction as of the beginning of 2023.

The 2022 Restructuring Program was approved in the third quarter of 2022 to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product execution in
alignment with our strategy. We expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, but this is subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing of
executing the 2022 Restructuring Program will be reflected in our results of operations.

The accrued restructuring balances as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were recorded as current liabilities within accrued compensation and benefits on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The cumulative cost of the 2022 Restructuring Program as of September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion.
Litigation charges and other includes a $401 million charge in the third quarter of 2023 for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009, we recorded and paid an EC fine that was subsequently
annulled, resulting in a benefit of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to "Note 13: Contingencies" within the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for
further information on legal proceedings related to the EC fine.
Also in the third quarter of 2023 we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during the first quarter of 2022 to acquire Tower in a cash-for-stock
transaction, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion as of the agreement date. We mutually agreed to terminate the agreement due to our inability to
obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner and we paid a termination fee in accordance with the terms of the agreement, resulting in a $353 million charge included
in Litigation charges and other.

Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if
any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period.
During the first nine months of 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in
multiple tax jurisdictions.
Note 8 : Investments
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds
and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and
floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, substantially all time deposits were issued by
institutions outside the US.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is
used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments
and the related derivative instruments recorded in interest and other, net. The fair value of our hedged investments was $16.1 billion as of September 30, 2023 ($16.2 billion as
of December 31, 2022). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $329 million in the third quarter of 2023 and net losses of $336 million
in the first nine months of 2023 ($861 million of net losses in the third quarter of 2022 and $1.8 billion of net losses in the first nine months of 2022). We recorded net gains on the
related derivatives of $320 million in the third quarter of 2023 and net gains of $354 million in the first nine months of 2023 ($916 million of net gains in the third quarter of 2022
and net gains of $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2022).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss). The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $6.1 billion as of September 30, 2023 ($10.2 billion as of December 31, 2022), which approximated the fair
value for these periods.

Over 90% of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting
our ability to liquidate these investments. The trading volume restrictions generally apply for as long as we own more than 1% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from
the rules of the respective exchange.

Note 9 : Divestitures
NAND Memory Business
On December 29, 2021, we closed the first phase of our agreement with SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) to divest our NAND memory business for $9.0 billion in cash. Our NAND
memory business includes our NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business), of which we deconsolidated our ongoing interests as part of
the sale. The transaction will be completed in two closings and upon the first closing in the first quarter of 2022, SK hynix paid $7.0 billion of consideration and we recognized a
pre-tax gain of $1.0 billion within interest and other, net, and tax expense of $495 million. We recorded a receivable in other long-term assets for the remaining proceeds of $1.9
billion which remains outstanding as of September 30, 2023, and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be no earlier than March 2025.
The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These
incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $500 million annually, and $1.5 billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update
the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business in light of the current business environment and projections, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and
penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
As of September 30, 2023, we also have a receivable due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $204 million recorded within other current assets on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. We will be reimbursed for costs of $32 million per quarter in 2023 for corporate function services, which include human resources,
information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements associated with being wholly owned subsidiaries.
Note 10 : Borrowings
In the third quarter of 2023, we remarketed $423 million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona (the
Arizona bonds) and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission (the Oregon bonds). The bonds are unsecured general obligations in accordance with loan
agreements we entered into with each of the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. The
bonds mature in 2035 and 2040 and have 3.8% and 4.1% coupons. Both the Arizona and Oregon bonds are subject to optional tender starting in February 2028 and mandatory
tender in June 2028, at which time we may remarket the bonds for a new term period.
In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility
agreement, extending the maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. The
revolving credit facilities had no borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2023.
We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion under our commercial paper program. In the first nine months of 2023, we settled in
cash $3.9 billion of our commercial paper. We had no outstanding commercial paper as of September 30, 2023 ($3.9 billion as of December 31, 2022).
Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to
certain restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness
and effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets, such as intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment, are recorded at
fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our nonmarketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or

grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments
approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of September 30, 2023 was $833 million (the aggregate carrying value as of
December 31, 2022 was $437 million). We have no reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months as of September 30, 2023 (the aggregate

Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of $2.2 billion related to
litigation involving VLSI and a charge of $401 million related to an EC-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims, management at present believes that
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends;
however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur.
Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate
monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order
prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may
result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is
in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have
not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.

European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered
Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments”
that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC
ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.
We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in
its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition.
In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in
February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.
In April 2022, the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us
based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We plan to appeal the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are
unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the
original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,”
that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the
industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities
was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
As of October 25, 2023, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US, Canada, and Argentina. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of
purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with the security vulnerabilities and assert a variety of common
law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in
the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs have
appealed that decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case pending in the Superior Court of
Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect. In Argentina, Intel Argentina was served with, and responded to, a
class action complaint in June 2022. The Argentinian court dismissed plaintiffs’ claims for lack of standing in May 2023, and plaintiffs have appealed. Additional lawsuits and
claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. We dispute the pending claims described above and intend to defend those lawsuits vigorously. Given
the procedural posture and the nature of those cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that
uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal
issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from those matters.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020
announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated
complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they
generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the court
granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs have appealed. Given the procedural posture and the nature
of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the
ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or
range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and
technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders
preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing
products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to
indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages,
accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may
discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and
processor products infringe eight patents that VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). Four patents remain at issue in the case, and VLSI estimates its damages to
be approximately $890 million, and seeks enhanced damages, future royalties, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. We filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions with the Patent
Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) in 2018 challenging patentability, and the parties stipulated to stay the district court action pending the PTAB’s review. The PTAB subsequently
found all claims of two patents, and some claims of two other patents, to be unpatentable. The district court lifted the stay in September 2021, and scheduled trial for March 2024
on the claims that were found patentable by the PTAB.
In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight
additional patents it had acquired from NXP:
▪ The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another
patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in prejudgment and post-judgment interest. We have appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court's rejection of Intel's claim to have a license
from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2021 and January 2022 the PTAB
instituted IPRs on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the
PTAB’s decisions, and has asked to stay those appeals while the PTAB decides certain issues unrelated to the merits of the IPRs. Intel has agreed to the stay.
▪ The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged
infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment.
▪ The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately
$949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment
as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu)
Co., Ltd. VLSI asserts one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property
Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI seeks an injunction as well
as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd.
asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an
injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision
finding no infringement and dismissing all claims.
We have accrued a charge of approximately $2.2 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are
unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.
R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation
In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in
the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger
Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors, and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in both actions prohibiting the
sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit.
Financial Statements Notes to Financial Statements 21

Table of Contents
Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the
patent is invalid. In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a
disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.
Trial is scheduled for December 2023 in the Dusseldorf Regional Court, and for April 2024 in the UK High Court of Justice. If defendants lose at trial in Germany, the Dusseldorf
Regional Court could impose an injunction and recall order prohibiting sales of the accused products in Germany which could take effect immediately and remain in place unless
overturned on appeal, or unless the patent is invalidated by the German Federal Patent Court. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there
are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and that uncertainty exists as to the scope of an injunction, if any, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the
potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these lawsuits.

Revenue
Segment Revenue Walk $B
Q3 2023 vs. Q3 2022
Our Q3 2023 revenue was $14.2 billion, down $1.2 billion or 8% from Q3 2022. CCG revenue decreased 3% from Q3 2022 primarily due to lower desktop volume driven by
lower demand across business market segments and lower notebook ASPs due to a higher mix of small core products attributable to relative strength in the education market
combined with a higher mix of older generation products. These decreases were partially offset by higher notebook volume as customer inventory levels began to normalize and
higher desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 10% from Q3 2022 due to lower server
volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of
high core count products. NEX revenue decreased 32% as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product
lines.
YTD 2023 vs. YTD 2022
Our YTD 2023 revenue was $38.8 billion, down $10.2 billion or 21% from YTD 2022. CCG revenue decreased 19% from YTD 2022 primarily due to lower notebook and desktop
volume due to lower demand and from customers tempering purchases to reduce inventories in the first half of 2023. Notebook ASPs decreased due to the relative strength in
the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products, and were partially offset by higher
desktop ASPs due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. DCAI revenue decreased 23% from YTD 2022 due to lower server
volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, which was partially offset by higher server ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a
higher mix of high core count products and an increase in revenue from the FPGA product line. NEX revenue decreased 34% from YTD 2022 as customers tempered purchases
to reduce existing inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.

Effective January 2023, we increased the estimated useful life of certain production machinery and equipment from 5 years to 8 years. When compared to the estimated useful
life in place as of the end of 2022, we expect total depreciation expense in 2023 to be reduced by $4.2 billion. We expect this change will result in an approximately $2.5 billion
increase to gross margin, a $400 million decrease in R&D expenses, and a $1.3 billion decrease in ending inventory values. These estimates are based on the assets in use and
under construction as of the beginning of 2023 and are calculated at that point in time. Because most of the depreciation expense associated with this useful life change is
included in overhead cost pools and is combined with other costs and other depreciation expense from assets placed into service after this calculation was performed, for which
such costs are subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through our manufacturing process, the actual amount of impact from the useful life change that is
included in our 2023 operating results and financial position is impractical to individually and specifically quantify on a year-over-year basis.
Operating Expenses
Total R&D and MG&A expenses for Q3 2023 were $5.2 billion, down 14% from Q3 2022, and $16.1 billion for YTD 2023, down 12% from YTD 2022. These expenses represent
36.8% of revenue for Q3 2023 and 39.4% of revenue for Q3 2022, and 41.4% of revenue for YTD 2023 and 37.5% of revenue for YTD 2022. In support of our strategy, described
in our 2022 Form 10-K, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires continued investments in R&D and focused
efforts to attract and retain talent. We have implemented certain cost-cutting measures while we continue to improve our product execution.

The 2022 Restructuring Program was approved in Q3 2022 to rebalance our workforce and operations to create efficiencies and improve our product execution in alignment with
our strategy. In YTD 2023, activity related to the 2022 Restructuring Program substantially related to cash settlement of previously accrued employee severance and benefit
arrangements as well as additional actions in Q2 and Q3 of 2023. We expect actions pursuant to the 2022 Restructuring Program to be substantially completed by the end of
2023, but this is subject to change. We expect that our 2022 Restructuring Plan, in conjunction with other initiatives, will reduce our cost structure and allow us to reinvest certain
of these cost savings in resources and capacity to develop, manufacture, market, sell, and deliver our products in furtherance of our strategy. The cumulative cost of the 2022
Restructuring Program as of September 30, 2023 was $1.2 billion.
Litigation charges and other includes a $401 million charge in Q3 2023 for an EC-imposed fine. In 2009 we recorded and paid an EC fine that was subsequently annulled,

Also in Q3 2023, we mutually agreed with Tower to terminate the acquisition agreement that was entered into during Q1 2022 and, as a result, we paid a $353 million termination

In Q3 2023, we recognized a benefit for taxes as we applied our year-to-date actual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income (loss) before taxes, which
reflects our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. Our effective tax rate increased in YTD 2023 compared to YTD 2022, due to the application of our actual YTD
effective tax rate, and our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses.
Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if
any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period.
In YTD 2023, we used this approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.

Total cash and investments $ 25,088 $ 28,801
Total debt $ 48,879 $ 42,051
See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD&A.
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and our total
cash and investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further
supplemented by the company's committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity. Other sources of liquidity in 2023 include $1.1 billion from partner contributions, net
proceeds of $1.6 billion from a secondary offering of Mobileye Class A common stock, and cash proceeds of $849 million from the sale of an approximate 20% minority stake in
our IMS business to Bain. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our
process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential and pending acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements
incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our total cash and investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain
cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our
payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices,
and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments.
Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments.
In the first quarter of 2023, we declared a reduced quarterly dividend on our common stock. This dividend reduction reflects our deliberate approach to capital allocation, is
expected to support the critical investments needed to execute our business strategy, and is designed to position us to create long-term value.
In October 2023 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on December 1, 2023, to
shareholders of record as of November 7, 2023. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination
of our Board of Directors.
In the first quarter of 2023, we issued a total of $11.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of
outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures. We also amended both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement, extending the
maturity date by one year to March 2028, and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, extending the maturity date to March 2024. We have other potential sources of
liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of
debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of
September 30, 2023, we had no outstanding commercial paper or borrowings on the revolving credit facilities.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and
financing receivables were in investment-grade securities.

Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
The decrease in cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2023 was primarily driven by our net operating loss in comparison to our net operating income for the first
nine months of 2022, partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and certain other adjustments, net.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures.
Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first nine months of 2023 compared to the first nine months of 2022, primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the
divestiture of our NAND business and proceeds for our remaining share of McAfee, both of which occurred in the first nine months of 2022; as well as higher purchases of shortterm investments, net of maturities and sales. These unfavorable cash impacts during the first nine months of 2023 were partially offset by lower investment activity in other
investments and acquisitions during the first nine months of 2023.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from partner
contributions and equity-related issuances.
Cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 2023 compared to cash used for financing activities in the first nine months of 2022. This was primarily due to net
proceeds from our debt issuance, net of debt and commercial paper repayments, proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares, proceeds from partner contributions and reduced
dividend payments in the first nine months of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these nonGAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between
periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating
our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Beginning in 2023, income tax
effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year
non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax
positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of
reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations.
Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates
comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Prior-period non-GAAP financial measures have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect this updated approach.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results
calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
Non-GAAP
adjustment or
measure
Definition Usefulness to management and investors
Acquisition-related
adjustments
Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets
consists of amortization of intangible assets such as
developed technology, brands, and customer
relationships acquired in connection with business
combinations. Charges related to the amortization of
these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales
and MG&A in our US GAAP financial statements.
Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated
useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and
thus are generally recorded over multiple years.
We exclude amortization charges for our acquisitionrelated intangible assets for purposes of calculating
certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are
inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the
timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These
adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current
operating performance and comparison to our past
operating performance and provide investors with
additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.
Share-based
compensation
Share-based compensation consists of charges related
to our employee equity incentive plans.
We exclude charges related to share-based
compensation for purposes of calculating certain nonGAAP measures because we believe these adjustments
provide better comparability to peer company results
and because these charges are not viewed by
management as part of our core operating performance.
We believe these adjustments provide investors with a
useful view, through the eyes of management, of our
core business model, how management currently
evaluates core operational performance, and additional
means to evaluate expense trends, including in
comparison to other peer companies.
Restructuring and
other charges
Restructuring charges are costs associated with a
formal restructuring plan and are primarily related to
employee severance and benefit arrangements. Other
charges may include periodic goodwill and asset
impairments, certain pension charges, and costs
associated with restructuring activity. Q3 2023 includes
an EC-imposed fine and a fee related to the termination
of our agreement to acquire Tower.
We exclude restructuring and other charges, including
any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods,
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures
because these costs do not reflect our core operating
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful
evaluation of our core operating performance and
comparisons to past operating results and provide
investors with additional means to evaluate expense
trends.
(Gains) losses on
equity investments,
net
(Gains) losses on equity investments, net consists of
ongoing mark-to-market adjustments on marketable
equity securities, observable price adjustments on nonmarketable equity securities, related impairment
charges, and the sale of equity investments and other.
We exclude these non-operating gains and losses for
purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures
because it provides better comparability between
periods. The exclusion reflects how management
evaluates the core operations of the business.
MD&A 39

Table of Contents
Gains (losses) from
divestiture
Gains (losses) are recognized at the close of a
divestiture, or over a specified deferral period when
deferred consideration is received at the time of closing.
Based on our ongoing obligation under the NAND wafer
manufacturing and sale agreement entered into in
connection with the first closing of the sale of our NAND
memory business on December 29, 2021, a portion of
the initial closing consideration was deferred and will be
recognized between first and second closing.
We exclude gains or losses resulting from divestitures
for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures
because they do not reflect our current operating
performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful
evaluation of our current operating performance and
comparisons to past operating results.
Adjusted free cash
flow
We reference a non-GAAP financial measure of
adjusted free cash flow, which is used by management
when assessing our sources of liquidity, capital
resources, and quality of earnings. Adjusted free cash
flow is operating cash flow adjusted for (1) additions to
property, plant, and equipment, net of proceeds from
capital grants and partner contributions, (2) payments
on finance leases, and (3) proceeds from the McAfee
equity sale.
This non-GAAP financial measure is helpful in
understanding our capital requirements and sources of
liquidity by providing an additional means to evaluate the
cash flow trends of our business. Since the 2017
divestiture, McAfee equity distributions and sales
contributed to prior operating and free cash flow, and
while the McAfee equity sale in Q1 2022 would have
typically been excluded from adjusted free cash flow as
an equity sale, we believe including the sale proceeds in
adjusted free cash flow facilitate a better, more
consistent comparison to past presentations of liquidity.
Total cash and
investments
Total cash and investments is used by management
when assessing our sources of liquidity, which include
cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
loans receivable and other.
This non-GAAP measure is helpful in understanding our
capital resources and liquidity position.
Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:

Form 8-K Disclosable Events
On October 23, 2023, a corrected copy of the Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Intel Corporation was filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may
not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity
prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2022 Form 10-K.
Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2022 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that
are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may
not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set
forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over
financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls
must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and
communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter
ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market
or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, we were authorized to repurchase up to
$110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf
of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs in a similar manner as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been
issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares
that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the
quarter ended September 30, 2023, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities,
transactions or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are
conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party
subject to one such sanction. From time to time, our local subsidiaries are required to engage with the FSB as a licensing authority and file documents in order to conduct
business within the Russian Federation. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by general licenses issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets
Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB. As announced on April 5, 2022, Intel suspended all
business operations in Russia until further notice, and we plan to continue limited activities as required to conduct business in the Russian Federation to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the
sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of
security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly
associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.

Exhibit 3.1
CORRECTED
THIRD RESTATED
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION
OF
INTEL CORPORATION
Intel Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Corporation”), does hereby certify, pursuant to Section 103 of the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) that:
1. The name of the Corporation is Intel Corporation.

on May 17, 2006, which requires correction as permitted by Section 103(f) of the DGCL.
3. The Certificate is an inaccurate record of the corporate action therein referred to because (i) the THIRD recital of the Certificate
inadvertently states that the Certificate is without further amendment when the Certificate contains amendments therein; and (ii) the
THIRD and FOURTH recitals of the Certificate inadvertently fail to reference that the Certificate was duly adopted pursuant to the
provisions of Section 242 of the DGCL.
4. The title and text of the Certificate in correct form is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
