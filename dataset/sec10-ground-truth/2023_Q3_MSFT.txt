Item 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
Our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods
presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in
conjunction with information included in the Microsoft Corporation fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 27, 2023.
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no
impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing
of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price of performance obligations, variable consideration, and
other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for
doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological
feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial
statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ
from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater
than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the
investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method.
Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based
on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we
evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is
less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence.
In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans
to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below
cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market,
industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
8

PART I
Item 1
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair
values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred
to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are
sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense),
net.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of
a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting
gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are
recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive
income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing
hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other
income (expense), net.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which
inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three
levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments
include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities
include those actively traded on exchanges.
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all
significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of
the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present
value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward
and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities,
foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our
Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap
contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including
option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes
and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment
charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are
determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables,
and discounted cash flow projections.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.

PART I
Item 1
Contract Balances and Other Receivables
As of both September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion
and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were
$10.2 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings
through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, our financing receivables, net
were $4.8 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets
and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled
accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential
common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options and stock awards.
The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:
(In millions, except earnings per share)

Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 22,291 $ 17,556

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment
returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing
the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not
qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
Foreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily
to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.
14

PART I
Item 1
Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that
are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign
exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on
certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.
Interest Rate
Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments
to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average
maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option,
futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables
below.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts.
These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage
credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging
instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured
debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet
these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of
September 30, 2023, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no
collateral was required to be posted.

NOTE 10 — INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate was 18% and 19% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in our
effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury
Department, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings
taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional
operations center in Ireland.
Uncertain Tax Positions
As of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities were $19.8 billion and $18.7 billion,
respectively, and are included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets.
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023,
we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer
pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we
believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the
NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these
issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our
income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for
tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected
to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 13 — CONTINGENCIES
U.S. Cell Phone Litigation
Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits,
including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular
handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire
Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are
consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal
Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that
their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits
also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.
In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed
scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general
causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for
evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the
defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental
expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of
2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an
order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023.
Irish Data Protection Commission Matter
In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted
advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated
throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR
violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a
final decision.
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although
management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our
consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in
the future.
As of September 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $597 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse
outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were
unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the
period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.
NOTE 14 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

NOTE 16 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews
certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the
periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent
Cloud, and More Personal Computing.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and
information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:
• Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office
licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance,
Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot.
• Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other Office services.

PART I
Item 1
• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.
• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP,
CRM (including Customer Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.
Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business
and developers. This segment primarily comprises:
• Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio,
System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.
• Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services,
Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our
technology. This segment primarily comprises:
• Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows
operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud
services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.
• Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.
• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and
in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and
other cloud services.
• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue
recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments
based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when
sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue
methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal,
including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services,
customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the
specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.

depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.
NOTE 17 — SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for a cash payment of $61.8 billion, net of
cash acquired. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will
accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.
Due to the limited amount of time since closing the transaction, the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is not yet complete. The initial
purchase price allocation will be provided within our Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, and we expect most of the
purchase price will be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. Activision Blizzard will be included in our consolidated
financial statements beginning on the date of acquisition and reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
Results of Review of Interim Financial Information
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
September 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial
information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim
financial information for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated
July 27, 2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.
Basis for Review Results
This interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with
the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of
applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less
in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an
opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

should be read in conjunction with, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023, and our financial statements and the
accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).
OVERVIEW
Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We
strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by
artificial intelligence (“AI”), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness,
improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.
We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and
supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our
most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter
operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes.
Highlights from the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 included:
• Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 24% to $31.8 billion.
• Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 15% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%.
• Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 3% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 76.7
million.
• LinkedIn revenue increased 8%.
• Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 22% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 28%.
• Server products and cloud services revenue increased 21% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.
• Windows revenue increased 5% with Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue growth of
4% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth of 8%.
• Devices revenue decreased 22%.
• Xbox content and services revenue increased 13%.
• Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 10%.

PART I
Item 2
Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an
opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft,
we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address
the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new
software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors
customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of
cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and
geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing
environment.
The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our
operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to
meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability
of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other
components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the
ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our
products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our
ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent
worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in
resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and
expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue and
expenses from our international operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024.
Refer to Risk Factors (Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven
by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven
by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.
Reportable Segments
We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More
Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 16 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to
Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q).

Metrics
We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We
disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the
continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how
customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, revising our
Microsoft Cloud revenue metric to include revenue growth and expanding our Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers metric to include Microsoft
365 Basic subscribers, aligning with how we manage our business.

effective tax rate for the current quarter compared to the prior year was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2024, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury
Department, which delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to earnings
taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional
operations center in Ireland.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023,
we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer
pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of September 30, 2023, we
believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the
NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these
issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our
income tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for
tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected
to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to
be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share
repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least
the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $144.0 billion and $111.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023,
respectively. Equity investments were $11.4 billion and $9.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Our short-term
investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade
fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated
securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest
rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that
correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments
held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.

PART I
Item 2
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our
financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and
preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value,
then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or
indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency
securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3
investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a
quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is
used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective
of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments
because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our brokerpriced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.
Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model
validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash from operations increased $7.4 billion to $30.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to an increase in
cash received from customers and a decrease in cash paid to suppliers. Cash from financing increased $25.6 billion to $14.8 billion for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to a $25.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments. Cash
from investing increased $3.6 billion to $503 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, mainly due to an $8.2 billion increase in
cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $3.6 billion increase in cash used for additions to property and
equipment.
Debt Proceeds
We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The proceeds of these
issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital
expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 9 – Debt of the Notes to Financial
Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”)
and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and
recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in
advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
38

PART I
Item 2
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of September 30, 2023:
(In millions)
Three Months Ending
December 31, 2023 $ 21,006
March 31, 2024 14,860
June 30, 2024 8,551
September 30, 2024 2,012
Thereafter 2,759
Total $ 49,188
If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and
services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription
period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 11 – Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this
Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
Income Taxes
As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax.
Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in
year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As of September 30, 2023, we had a remaining transition tax liability of $7.7 billion, of
which $3.7 billion is short-term and payable in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025.
Share Repurchases
For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 11 million shares and 17 million shares of our common stock for
$3.6 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of
September 30, 2023, $18.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes
to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Dividends
For the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.75 per share and $0.68
per share, totaling $5.6 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends,
subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of
this Form 10-Q) for further discussion.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
On October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. for a cash payment of $61.8 billion, net of cash acquired.
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as
acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and
computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to
increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance
leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have
not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to
materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
39

PART I
Item 2
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and
expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material
impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition,
impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products
and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant
judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine
whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud
service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency,
and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation.
Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to
estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional
charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine
whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using
information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and
services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information
such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the
exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate
customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to
recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information
becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Impairment of Investment Securities
We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among
other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This
determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse
conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than
not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in
other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate,
we may incur future impairments.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the
investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic
basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is
determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.
40

PART I
Item 2
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our
reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its
carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance
indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities
to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each
reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments,
including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business,
estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and
other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for
each reporting unit.
Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has
been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for
general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have
determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved
through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is
included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.
Legal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss
contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate,
among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss.
Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred
tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements
from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income
tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required
in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.
Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
41

PART I
Item 2
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing
overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of
completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers,
and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development
plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to
manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily
to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro,
Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average
maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broadbased indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
The following table sets forth the potential loss in future earnings or fair values, including associated derivatives, resulting from hypothetical
changes in relevant market rates or prices:

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we
have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these
disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter
ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Refer to Note 13 – Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) for information regarding legal
proceedings in which we are involved.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.
STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS
We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating
margins.
Competition in the technology sector
Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized
firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry
in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies,
shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in
making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.
Competition among platform-based ecosystems
An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse
solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that
can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face
significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms.
• A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and
related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles,
wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the
hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be
able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated
hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we
increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins.
• We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from
competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices
compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning
to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these
devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract
application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may
decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their
competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer
(“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform.
44

PART II
Item 1A
• Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility
of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move
data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to
write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value.
Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our
operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute
products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives.
Business model competition
Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.
• Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the licensebased proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting
original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue
received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers
under this model.
• We are investing in artificial intelligence (“AI”) across the entire company and infusing generative AI capabilities into our
consumer and commercial offerings. We expect AI technology and services to be a highly competitive and rapidly evolving
market. We will bear significant development and operational costs to build and support the AI capabilities, products, and
services necessary to meet the needs of our customers. To compete effectively we must also be responsive to technological
change, potential regulatory developments, and public scrutiny.
• Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services, and content, and make money by selling third-party
advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little
cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.
• Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, using
open source AI models, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full
costs of research and development for the open source products. Some open source products mimic the features and
functionality of our products.
The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as
for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.
Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloudbased services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class
platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the
same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and
delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of
which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present
enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must
continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate
obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a
network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving
ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT
Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.
45

PART II
Item 1A
Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These
costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution
in several areas, including:
• Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.
• Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices,
including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.
• Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.
• Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as
well as help them meet their own compliance needs.
• Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including
those of our competitors.
It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing
organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new
products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may
negatively impact gross margins and operating income.
Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts
through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that
violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to
control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage.
RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS
We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant
investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating
system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition,
we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the
development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming
devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including
innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing
significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably
affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years,
if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and
businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft
Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will
continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or
product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality.
Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant
problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue.
46

PART II
Item 1A
Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making
acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2022 we
completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc., and in October 2023 we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc.
(“Activision Blizzard”). In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions
and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an
unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating
and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that
announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a
party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend
in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired
companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than
expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the
benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. In addition, an acquisition may be subject to challenge even after it has been completed.
For example, the Federal Trade Commission continues to challenge our Activision Blizzard acquisition and could, if successful, alter or unwind
the transaction. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We
acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an
impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in
circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in
our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we
participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial
statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our
results of operations.
CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS
Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation
or competitive position.
Security of our information technology
Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored
organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide
variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed
processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and
datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other
sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to
launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to
plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic
or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in
unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no
longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential
information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier
accounts or hardware.

PART II
Item 1A
Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and
successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may
allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed
across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could
disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of
their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or
competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to
allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also
subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software
updates.
In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new
ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other
consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for
adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging
cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide.
Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data
The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud
and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology
products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services
rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our
services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and
services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud
environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several
of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches
if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional
malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers
embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’
accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in
unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or
services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that
may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because
generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI
may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries.
Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired
over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate
the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product,
service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and
standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our
technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity
practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for
our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations
and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.
48

PART II
Item 1A
Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to
notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help
protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to
detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially
where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’
computing environments.
Development and deployment of defensive measures
To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously
engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software
updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help
to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the
integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and
information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services,
health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services.
The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well,
actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our
reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or
services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional
products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software
or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate
security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims
against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these
provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability
exposure to customers.
Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there
is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability
claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position.
Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth,
and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The
continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.
Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over
personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper
disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our
customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal
exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.
Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in
a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid
legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government
authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of
personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based
solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user
concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or
governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.
49

PART II
Item 1A
We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others. LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and
services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made
commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may
weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it
for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services.
Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.
Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses
For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub,
LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively
affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including
through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of
our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or
responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be
successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.
Other digital safety abuses
Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in
violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies,
and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and
user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have
been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational
damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements.
The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the
intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial
risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their
intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not
develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited
interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy
customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our
technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement
actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.
50

PART II
Item 1A
Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our
offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI
may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We
envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and
personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI
algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content
generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by
Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or
result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other
challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action,
legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), new applications of
existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical
issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or
customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other
social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated
financial statements.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations
infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing
power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network
infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and
buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. The
cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy
economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce
new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account
services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the
incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services
provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires
development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet
connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that
continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet
connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products,
services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our
reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated
financial statements.
We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we
design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant
expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or
address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs.
Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may
contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions
and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially
magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and
revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although
our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will
withstand legal challenge.
51

PART II
Item 1A
There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand
for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of
supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain
timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development
of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may
increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other
geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating
margins.
LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS
Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products.
Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and
regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow
competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought
enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business.
For example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms
on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other
companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws.
Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a
result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition
rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have
advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property.
Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to
consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions
could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely
affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of
our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on
acquisitions that may reduce their value.
Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational
damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt
payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and
records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be
based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws.
Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law
enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021,
which presents compliance challenges as it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also
have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we
devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls
designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, partners, vendors, or agents may violate our policies.
Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against
us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation.
52

PART II
Item 1A
Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade
and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S.
export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified
countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow
for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign
adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense
diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade
restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among
our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm,
operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions.
Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs,
legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies
increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer
of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate
under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge
which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again
block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and
restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services.
In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the
EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data.
More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital
Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to
build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources
from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or
help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less
attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if
regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement
actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of product offerings or of
international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against
large technology companies, and European data protection authorities have taken action to block or remove services from their markets.
Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and
regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data.
Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to
operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be
constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and
inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent
requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer
and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data
may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or
greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain
features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant
penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort.
53

PART II
Item 1A
Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide
range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services
offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and
online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code,
increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings
being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants
may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations,
including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and
regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to
cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving
digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to
achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict
opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the
operation of our AI services in the European market.
How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from
jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve.
Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business
practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease
the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and
other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales
opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions.
We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These
claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI
services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or
all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our
business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the
future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable
outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable.
Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government
contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we
may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental
contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some
agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may
be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our
products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.
We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is
required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and
possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in
our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance
evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our
results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements.
54

PART II
Item 1A
We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax
estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to
increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal
Revenue Service audit for prior tax years and have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for the tax years 2004
to 2013. The primary issues in the NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment
of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the
amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or
periods in which that determination is made.
We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing
statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country
may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to
corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in
taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial
statements.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS
We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating
results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other
intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent
respect for patent rights.
Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents.
Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their
obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly
in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected.
Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source
code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products
by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could
increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors.
Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property
rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available,
stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse
outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or
services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual
property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.

PART II
Item 1A
GENERAL RISKS
If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed. Our reputation and brands are
globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business,
and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality
issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from
customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or
public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things:
• The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like.
• Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content.
• Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees.
The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are
damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.
Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession,
pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs,
servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely
affected.
Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been
a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or
retailer, could cause sales channel disruption.
Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a
result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.
We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity,
market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant
part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a
downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be
adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment
charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements.
Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of
a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing
sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and
development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business
operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the
destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could
harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium
on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged
service outages in our consolidated financial statements.
56

PART II
Item 1A
Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose economic and other risks, which
may negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers, increase our operating costs, or otherwise disrupt our operations in
markets both directly and indirectly impacted by such events. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for
technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change
may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to
national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do
business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.
The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and
results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration
and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic
activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks
described in these Risk Factors.
We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our
revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation.
The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or
changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services,
including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and
cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services.
Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant
part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks.
Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as
well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which
presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing
and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and
political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or
agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local
sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign
countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair
our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure,
significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations.
Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and
retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders
in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that
enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit
internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and
professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting
efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may
be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of
knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws
are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our
workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally
who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or
join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to
respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives.
