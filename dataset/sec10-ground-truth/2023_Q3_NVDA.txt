NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 29, 2023 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, as filed with the SEC,
but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position, have been included. The results for the
interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in
conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended January 29, 2023.
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies disclosed in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 29, 2023.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 are both 52-week years. The third
quarters of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going
basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts
receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other
charges, property, plant, and equipment, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable.
In February 2023, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and
usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of our server, storage, and network equipment from three to a range of four to
five years, and our assembly and test equipment from five to seven years. This change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning
of fiscal year 2024. Based on the carrying amounts of a majority of our server, storage, network, and assembly and test equipment, net, in use
as of the end of fiscal year 2023, the estimated effect of this change for the three months ended October 29, 2023 was a benefit of $17 million
and $24 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $41 million and
net income of $36 million after tax, or $0.01 per both basic and diluted share. The estimated effect of this change for the first nine months of
fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $24 million and $83 million

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(Unaudited)
for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $107 million and net income of
$91 million after tax, or $0.04 per both basic and diluted share.
Note 2 - Business Combination
Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement
In February 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank Group Corp, or SoftBank, announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby
NVIDIA would have acquired Arm Limited, or Arm, from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate due to significant regulatory challenges
preventing the completion of the transaction. We recorded an acquisition termination cost of $1.35 billion in fiscal year 2023 reflecting the writeoff of the prepayment provided at signing.
Note 3 - Leases
Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data
center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2024 and 2035.
Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of October 29, 2023 are as follows:

In addition, we have operating leases, primarily for our data centers, that are expected to commence between the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2024 and fiscal year 2025 with lease terms of 3 to 10 years for $924 million.
Operating lease expenses were $69 million and $49 million for the third quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $195 million and
$139 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Short-term and variable lease expenses for the third quarter
and first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

income per share.
Note 6 – Income Taxes
Income tax was an expense of $1.28 billion and $2.24 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a
benefit of $67 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of
income before income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a
benefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, audit of our federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2018
and 2019 was resolved. We recognized a non-cash net benefit of $145 million, related to this IRS audit resolution, for effectively settled
positions. This benefit consists of a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits of $236 million and related accrued interest of $17 million, net of
federal benefit partially offset by additional cash tax payments and reductions in tax attribute carryforwards of $108 million.
The effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based
compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax
rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.
Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to tax
benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based compensation and the U.S. federal research tax credit. Our effective
tax rate for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the IRS audit resolution.

Other than the IRS audit resolution, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, there were no material changes to our tax years that remain
subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no other material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and
any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not
that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.
Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are
made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 29, 2023, we do not believe
that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating
expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded
in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized
in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities
that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding:

As of October 29, 2023, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months. The expected realized gains and losses
deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was
not significant.
During the first nine months of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective.

Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint
on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to
channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also
alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class
certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert
fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the
complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from
judgment

panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district
court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth

The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG,

plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case,
but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. Following the
Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in this
derivative matter. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of
fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the
dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU

The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,

resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. Following the Ninth Circuit’s denial of NVIDIA’s
petition for rehearing on November 15, 2023, the parties will meet and confer regarding the next steps in these derivative matters. The lawsuits
assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on
the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU
demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and
unspecified corporate governance measures.
Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang,
et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the
Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to
channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including
disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of October 29, 2023, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based
on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in
these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of
business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a
material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged
across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Compute & Networking or Graphics for purposes of
making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate
infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, intellectual property related, or IP-related costs, acquisition termination cost,
and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense
directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, our CODM does not evaluate
depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.
The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our
reportable segments and the “All Other” category.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
Since our founding in 1993, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 has sparked the growth of
the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI and has fueled industrial digitalization across markets. NVIDIA
is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.
Our two operating segments are "Compute & Networking" and "Graphics," as described in Note 15 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models
Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers and entered into prepaid
supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our
supply chain may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity
arrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our
inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
25

We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity
commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand
expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles or enter new lines of business, which may
require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity.
Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners
prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the
architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch
cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges
associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers
anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can
create reductions or volatility in our revenue. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges and
quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and delay
further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our
technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we
have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,
may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.
We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist such as our Omniverse platform, thirdparty large language models, and generative AI models. We have recently begun offering enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX cloud services
directly and through our network of partners, which includes cloud-based infrastructure and software and services for training and deploying AI
models, and NVIDIA AI Foundations for customizable pretrained AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services
can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use
cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand
for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown.
Global Trade
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,
impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or
boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100
products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
On October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports
to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding
Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The
licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an
ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements
were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. These licensing requirements did not have a
meaningful impact on our revenue in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 as they were announced near the end of the fiscal quarter and we had
additional demand from customers outside of the named country groups. Our sales to China and other affected destinations, derived from
products that are now subject to licensing requirements, have consistently contributed approximately 20-25% of Data Center revenue over the
past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, though we
believe the decline will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions.
We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulation-compliant solutions, including those for which the USG does
not wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the
26

extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance
that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.
Our competitive position has been harmed, and our competitive position and future results may be further harmed over the long-term, if there are
further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has
changed and may again change the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and
licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our
inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding
us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East. Our sales to China will decrease
significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024.
While we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-Pacific, including
China, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative
manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.
Macroeconomic Factors
Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints and global economic
and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While
difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors can also impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs
for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing strategy generally does not fluctuate with short-term
changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.
Israel
We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our
approximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our
networking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted
employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.
Further, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have been called-up for active military duty in
Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate period, which may cause disruption to our
product development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any significant impact or expense to our
business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and revenue or create other uncertainty for
our business.

We specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate
processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and
27

services to deliver unique value. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional
Visualization, and Automotive.
Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $18.12 billion, up 206% from a year ago and up 34% sequentially.
Data Center revenue was up 279% from a year ago and up 41% sequentially. Strong sales of the NVIDIA HGX platform were driven by global
demand for the training and inferencing of large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Data Center
compute grew 324% from a year ago and 38% sequentially, largely reflecting the strong ramp of our Hopper GPU architecture-based HGX
platform from cloud service providers, or CSPs, including GPU-specialized CSPs; consumer internet companies; and enterprises. Our sales of
Ampere GPU architecture-based Data Center products were significant but declined sequentially, as we approach the tail end of this
architecture. We recognized initial revenue on the ramp of our L40S GPU and the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip for a broad range of
customers. CSPs drove roughly half of Data Center revenue, while consumer internet companies and enterprises comprised approximately the
other half. Networking was up 155% from a year ago and up 52% sequentially, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to
support our HGX platform.
Gaming revenue was up 81% from a year ago and up 15% sequentially. Strong year-on-year growth reflects higher sell-in to partners following
normalization of channel inventory levels. Sequential growth reflects strong demand for our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for back-to-school
and the start of the holiday season.
Professional Visualization revenue was up 108% from a year ago and up 10% sequentially. The year-on-year increase reflects higher sell-in to
partners following normalization of channel inventory levels. The sequential increase was primarily due to stronger enterprise workstation
demand and the ramp of notebook workstations based on the Ada Lovelace GPU architecture.
Automotive revenue was up 4% from a year ago and up 3% sequentially. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects growth in sales of auto
cockpit solutions and self-driving platforms. The sequential increase was driven by sales of self-driving platforms.
Gross margin increased significantly from a year ago and sequentially, driven by improved product mix from Data Center revenue growth and
lower net inventory provisions and related charges.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and related charges were $681 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or
settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $239 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture
products. The net inventory provisions were $442 million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 2.4 percentage points.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, provisions for inventory and related charges were $702 million. Sales of previously reserved inventory or
settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $21 million. The net inventory provisions were $681
million and the unfavorable effect on our gross margin was 11.5 percentage points.
Operating expenses were up 16% from a year ago and up 12% sequentially, driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based
compensation, primarily reflecting growth in employees and compensation increases.

Compute & Networking - The increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2023 was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute GPUs grew 369% year-on-year and 193% compared to the first
nine months of fiscal year 2023 led by strong demand for the NVIDIA HGX platform driven by global demand for the training and inferencing of
large language models, recommendation engines and inferencing of generative AI applications. Networking was up 155% year-on-year and 99%
compared to the first nine months of last year, almost entirely due to strong growth in InfiniBand infrastructure to support our HGX platform.
Graphics - The increase in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflects growth in Gaming GPUs
reflecting higher sell-in to partners following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this year. The decrease in the first nine months of
fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023 primarily reflects 57% lower enterprise graphics and 14% lower
Professional Visualization GPUs, partially offset by 7% growth in Gaming GPUs, following normalization of channel inventory levels earlier this
year.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to end customers, or End
Customers, such as CSPs, enterprises, and gamers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States
accounted for 65% and 62% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and 64% and 71% of
total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.
Our customers include original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system builders, system integrators, add-in board
manufacturers, retailers/distributors, automotive manufacturers, tier-1 automotive suppliers, and other enterprises.
Sales to Customer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total
revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original
equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. Our sales to Customer A
and Customer B were largely in support of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and
17% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have
represented approximately 13% and 10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of
these End Customers were primarily attributable to our Compute & Networking segment.
Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain concentrated.
In the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2023,
one customer represented 10% of total revenue, primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.
Gross Margin
Our overall gross margin increased to 74.0% and 70.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, from 53.6%
and 55.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
30

respectively. The year over year increase in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 was primarily due to improved product mix
from Data Center revenue growth of 279% and 156%, respectively, and lower net inventory provisions and related charges.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $681 million and $1.39 billion for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted
in a provision release of $239 million and $372 million, primarily from Ampere GPU architecture products, for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.4% and 2.6% in the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal year 2024.
Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $702 million and $2.01 billion for the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory or settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted
in a provision release of $21 million and $59 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. The net effect on
our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.5% and 9.3% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.

Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The increase in interest income was due to
higher yields.
Interest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.
Other, net, consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-affiliated entities and the impact of changes in foreign
currency rates. The loss in Other, net, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was driven by mark-to-market losses from publicly traded equity
investments.
Income Taxes
Income tax was an expense of $1.28 billion and $2.24 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a
benefit of $67 million and $61 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of
income before income tax was an expense of 12.2% and 11.3% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively, and a
benefit of 10.9% and 2.1% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2023, respectively.
32

The effective tax rate increased due to a decreased impact of tax benefits from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, stock-based
compensation, and the U.S. federal research tax credit, relative to the increase in income before income tax. The increase in the effective tax
rate was partially offset by a benefit due to the IRS audit resolution.

As of October 29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, an increase of $4.99 billion from the end of
fiscal year 2023. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and
credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
due to growth in revenue, partially offset by higher accounts receivable balance and taxes paid. Accounts receivable balance in the third quarter
of fiscal year 2024 reflected approximately $570 million from customer payments received ahead of the invoice due date.
Cash provided by investing activities decreased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023,
primarily driven by lower marketable securities maturities.
Cash used in financing activities increased in the first nine months of fiscal year 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal year 2023, due
to a debt repayment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 and higher tax payments related to RSUs, partially offset by lower share
repurchases.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
October 29, 2023, we had $18.28 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt
securities issued by the USG and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as
certificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to
Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to
meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, and for the foreseeable future, including our debt obligations, future supply
obligations and vendor and supplier prepayments. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external
capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.
Except for approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued
any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S., substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities held outside of the U.S. as of October 29, 2023 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
We
33

paid $4.35 billion in cash taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, largely for previously deferred federal income tax payments related to the
disaster relief made available by the IRS for certain California taxpayers.
Capital Return to Shareholders
During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, we returned $3.72 billion and $7.01 billion, respectively, in share repurchases
and $99 million and $296 million, respectively, in cash dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to the continuing determination by our
Board of Directors that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
On August 21, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an increase to our share repurchase program of an additional $25.00 billion, without
expiration. As of October 29, 2023, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock
up to $25.24 billion. From October 30, 2023 through November 17, 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million shares for $366 million pursuant to a Rule
10b5-1 trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees. We may pursue additional share
repurchases as we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities. We plan to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.
The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee
compensation made after December 31, 2022. This provision has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations
We have unrecognized tax benefits of $1.10 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $115 million recorded in non-current income
tax payable as of October 29, 2023. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties
in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
Financial market risks related to investment and interest rate risk are described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there have been no
material changes to the financial market risks described as of January 29, 2023.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
The impact of foreign currency transactions related to foreign exchange rate risk is described in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023. As of October 29, 2023, there
have been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 29, 2023.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of October 29, 2023, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) were effective to provide
reasonable assurance.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. In fiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our enterprise resource planning, or
ERP, system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial
records used to report operating results. The upgrade will occur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes
that materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023 and Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal
quarters ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023.
Purchasing or owning NVIDIA common stock involves investment risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, in Items 1A of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters
ended April 30, 2023 and July 30, 2023, and below. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or
that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Failure to estimate customer demand properly has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.
We use third parties to manufacture and assemble our products, and we have long manufacturing lead times. We are not provided guaranteed
wafer, component and capacity supply, and our supply deliveries and production may be non-linear within a quarter or year. If our estimates of
customer demand are ultimately inaccurate, as we have experienced in the past, there could be a significant mismatch between supply and
demand. This mismatch has resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, has varied across our market platforms, and has
significantly harmed our financial results.
We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have in the past entered and may in the future
enter into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our
business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles
or enter new lines of business, which may require us to integrate new suppliers into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain
complexity. Additionally, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components from third parties that are necessary
for the finished product are not available. This risk may increase as a result of our platform strategy. In periods of shortages impacting the
semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain, the lead times on our orders may be extended. We have previously
experienced and may continue to experience extended lead times of more than 12 months. We have paid premiums and provided deposits to
secure future supply and capacity, which have increased our product costs and may continue to do so. If our existing suppliers are unable to
scale their capabilities to meet our supply needs, we may require additional sources of capacity, which may require additional deposits. We may
not have the ability to reduce our supply commitments at the same rate or at all if our revenue declines.
Many additional factors have caused and/or could in the future cause us to either underestimate or overestimate our customers’ future demand
for our products, or otherwise cause a mismatch between supply and demand for our products and impact the timing and volume of our revenue,
including:
• changes in product development cycles and time to market;
• competing technologies and competitor product releases and announcements;
• changes in business and economic conditions resulting in decreased end demand;
• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or actions to control case spread of global or local health issues;
• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;
• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;
• new or unexpected end use cases;
• increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions;
36

• business decisions made by third parties;
• the demand for accelerated or AI-related cloud services, including our own software and NVIDIA DGX cloud services;
• changes that impact the ecosystem for the architectures underlying our products and technologies;
• the demand for our products relating to cryptocurrency mining, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and
generative AI models; or
• government actions or changes in governmental policies, such as export controls or increased restrictions on gaming usage.
Demand for our data center systems and products has surged over the last three quarters and our demand visibility extends into next year. To
meet this expected demand, we have increased our purchase obligations with existing suppliers, added new suppliers, and entered into prepaid
supply and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new suppliers into our
supply chain, may create more supply chain complexity and execution risk. We expect to continue to enter into supplier and capacity
arrangements and expect our supply to increase each quarter through next year. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our
inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.
Our customer orders and longer-term demand estimates may change or may not be correct, as we have experienced in the past. Product
transitions are complex and can impact our revenue as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our
channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of
transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data
Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify
the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to long manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products,
customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product
introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for
current generation architectures when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same
time for current and future architecture transitions. If we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason, our
financial results may be negatively impacted. In addition, the bring up of new product architectures is complex due to functionality challenges
and quality concerns not identified in manufacturing testing. These product quality issues may incur costs, increase our warranty costs, and
delay further production of our architecture. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our
technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we
have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult,
may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs.
Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple original equipment manufacturers, original device
manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. As a result, the decisions made by our multiple original equipment
manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners, and in response to changing market
conditions and changes in end user demand for our products have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly
forecast demand, particularly as they are based on estimates provided by various downstream parties.
If we underestimate our customers' future demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to
increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill orders on a timely basis. Even if we are able to increase
production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a timely manner, or our contract manufacturers may experience
supply constraints. If we cannot procure sufficient supply to meet demand or otherwise fail to fulfill our customers’ orders on a timely basis, or at
all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed. Additionally,
since some of our products are part of a
37

complex data center buildout, supply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader
revenue impact.
If we overestimate our customers’ future demand for our products, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our
competitors, we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitments. In the past, we have experienced a
reduction in average selling prices, including due to channel pricing programs that we have implemented and may continue to implement, as a
result of our overestimation of future demand, and we may need to continue these reductions. We have had to increase prices for certain of our
products as a result of our suppliers’ increase in prices, and we may need to continue to do so for other products in the future. We have also
written-down our inventory, incurred cancellation penalties, and recorded impairments. These impacts were amplified by our placement of noncancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms, well in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make
changes to the design of future products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and
prepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these factors may negatively
impact our gross margins and financial results.
We build technology and products for use cases and applications that may be new or may not yet exist, such as NVIDIA DGX cloud services,
NVIDIA AI Foundations, our Omniverse platform, third-party large language models and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new
use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate
significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. New technologies such as generative AI models have emerged, and while
they have driven increased demand for Data Center compute infrastructure, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Because our products may be
used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative AI
models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand. Additionally, we started shipping our CPU product offerings, the Grace CPU and Grace
Hopper Superchips, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our ability to adequately predict our CPU demand may create volatility in our revenue
or supply levels.
Challenges in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both a global and regional basis. Extended lead
times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or other events. In addition, geopolitical
tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant portion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract
manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to our supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.
The use of our GPUs other than that for which they were designed and marketed, including new and unexpected use cases, has impacted and
can in the future impact demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years
ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any reasonable
degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining, on demand for
our products. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including new compute technologies, price changes in cryptocurrencies, government
cryptocurrency policies and regulations, new cryptocurrency standards, and changes in the method of verifying blockchain transactions, has
impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our products and can further impact our ability to estimate demand
for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the Ethereum 2.0 merge in 2022, have
reduced and may in the future decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining. This has created and may in the future create increased
aftermarket sales of our GPUs, which could negatively impact retail prices for our GPUs and reduce demand for our new GPUs. We previously
introduced Lite Hash Rate, or LHR, GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and provided cryptocurrency mining processors, or
CMP, products in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Following the Ethereum 2.0 merge, NVIDIA Ampere and
Ada Lovelace GPU architectures no longer include LHR. In general, our new products or previously sold products may be resold online or on the
unauthorized “gray market,” which also makes demand forecasting difficult. Gray market products and reseller marketplaces compete with our
new products and distribution channels.
Additionally, we depend on developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain accelerated computing applications
that leverage our platforms. We also rely on third-party content providers and publishers to make their content available on our platforms such as
GeForce NOW. Failure by
38

developers, customers, and other third parties to build, enhance, and maintain applications that leverage our platforms, or failure by third-party
content providers or publishers to make their content available on reasonable terms or at all for use by our customers or end users on our
platforms, could adversely affect customer demand.
International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.
We sell our products internationally, and we also have operations and conduct business internationally. Our semiconductor wafers are
manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 65% and 62% of our
revenue during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 from sales outside of the United States, respectively. Due to recent
USG licensing requirements, we expect that our sales to China and other affected destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2024. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in
the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including domestic and international
economic and political conditions between countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to
control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, domestic
and international business and cultural practices that differ, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, and/or currency fluctuations,
and natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, and other catastrophic events.
Business disruptions could harm our operations, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, power or water shortages,
telecommunications failures, supplier disruptions, terrorist attacks, or acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military
actions, epidemics or pandemics, abrupt regulatory deterioration, and other natural or man-made disasters and catastrophic events. Our
corporate headquarters, a large portion of our current data center capacity, and a portion of our research and development activities are located
in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, making our
operations vulnerable to natural disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas.
Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and
development systems and personnel. Geopolitical and domestic political developments and other events beyond our control, can increase
economic volatility globally. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries
in which we do business may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Worldwide geopolitical tensions and conflicts,
including but not limited to China, Hong Kong, Israel, Korea and Taiwan where the manufacture of our product components and final assembly of
our products are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirements, and other disruptions that could impact our operations and
operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. For example, other countries have restricted and may
continue in the future to restrict business with the State of Israel, where we have engineering, sales support operations and manufacturing, and
companies with Israeli operations, including by economic boycotts. Our operations could be harmed and our costs could increase if
manufacturing, logistics or other operations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, power
shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.
The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers of being located and consolidated in certain geographical areas is
unknown. In the event a disaster, war or catastrophic event affects us, the third-party systems on which we rely, or our customers, our business
could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, and substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume
operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.
We are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the health and safety of our
approximately 3,400 employees in the region who primarily support the research and development, operations, and sales and marketing of our
networking products. Our operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 include expenses for financial support to impacted
employees and charitable activity. We believe our global supply chain for our networking products has not experienced any significant impact.
Further, in connection with the conflict, a significant number and percentage of our employees have
39

been called-up for active military duty in Israel. Accordingly, some of our employees in Israel may be absent for an extended and indeterminate
period, which may cause disruption to our product development or operations. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we did not experience any
significant impact or expense to our business; however, if the conflict is extended, it could impact future product development, operations, and
revenue or create other uncertainty for our business.
Additionally, interruptions or delays in services from CSPs, data center co-location partners, and other third parties on which we rely, including
due to the events described above or other events such as the insolvency of these parties, could impair our ability to provide our products and
services and harm our business. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems and services, our exposure to damage from service
interruptions, defects, disruptions, outages, shortages and other performance and quality problems may increase. Data centers depend on
access to clean water and predictable energy. Power or water shortages, or regulations that limit energy or water availability, could impair the
ability of our customers to expand their data center capacity and consume our products and services.
We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be able to successfully
integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help
expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives. Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our
ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we
pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If
we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to
pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition
less attractive, and other changes can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our
business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived
ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, our investments in
publicly traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have
invested and may continue to invest in private companies to further our strategic objectives and to support certain key business initiatives. These
companies can include early-stage companies still defining their strategic direction. Many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. To the extent any of the companies in
which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our investment. Our investment portfolio may
contain industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses. We face
additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s
attention; difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings
initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the
assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.
Additional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in integrating the technology, systems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees,
including key personnel, of the acquired business;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
• integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;
40

• stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise
unable to close an acquisition;
• potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt
covenants or other restrictions;
• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
• exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers.
For example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges
including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic
data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration
personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of
sales to End Customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these End
Customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. Sales to
Customer A represented 12% of total revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, and sales to Customer B represented 11% of total revenue
for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. With several of these
channel partners, we are selling multiple products and systems in our portfolio through their channels. Our operating results depend on sales
within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners
may decide to purchase fewer products, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other
way. Because most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change or delay product purchase
commitments with little notice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may
purchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase
our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Our sales to Customer A and Customer B were largely in
support of two End Customers. One End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 15% and 17% of total revenue for the third
quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. A second End Customer is estimated to have represented approximately 13% and
10% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. Both of these End Customers were primarily
attributable to our Compute & Networking segment. Our estimated Compute & Networking End Customer demand is expected to remain
concentrated. Our customers sell to End Customers. Our End Customers often do not purchase directly from us but purchase through multiple
original equipment manufacturers, original device manufacturers, system integrators, distributors, and other channel partners. If end demand
increases or our finished goods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners
may have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any of our large
customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or other countries’ trade restrictions, or
any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject, and political and other
actions may adversely impact our business.
We are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership
and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business
acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising;
41

employment; product regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; climate change;
cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, could impact our competitive position,
and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and ship our products. There can be no assurance that our
employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not violate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have
designed to help ensure compliance with such laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our
employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we
are subject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs and/or further
restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, we may face increased compliance
costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in markets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators
worldwide, including the European Union, the United States, and China. For example, the French Competition Authority collected information
from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider market as part of an ongoing inquiry into
competition in those markets. We have also received requests for information from regulators in the European Union and China regarding our
sales of GPUs and our efforts to allocate supply, and we expect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Revisions to laws or
regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase to import
duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business
plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public perception of governments in the regions where we operate or
plan to operate could negatively impact our business and results of operations.
Government actions, including trade protection and national security policies of U.S. and foreign government bodies, such as tariffs, import or
export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on the activities of U.S. persons, trade and economic sanctions,
decrees, quotas or other trade barriers and restrictions could affect our ability to ship products, provide services to our customers and
employees, do business without an export license with entities on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s U.S. Entity List or other U.S. government
restricted parties lists (which is expected to change from time to time), and generally fulfill our contractual obligations and have a material
adverse effect on our business. If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable non-U.S.
laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available under the laws, any of which could
have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
For example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and export control
measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and certain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year
2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. Concurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted End
Customer sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.
The increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that target products and
services capable of enabling or facilitating AI, and may in the future result in additional restrictions impacting some or all of our product and
service offerings.
Concerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns relating to the misuse of AI
applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral or multilateral restrictions on products that can be
used for training, refining, and deploying large language models. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of
downstream customers and users worldwide to acquire, deploy, and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and
negatively impact our business and financial results.
Such restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, including but not limited to AI
technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, including GPUs and associated products, are
increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in the U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral
controls restricting GPUs and associated products, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls
have been and may again be very broad in scope and
42

application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one or more markets, including but not limited to China, and could
negatively impact our manufacturing, testing, and warehousing locations and options, or could impose other conditions that limit our ability to
serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business, revenue, and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs
and semiconductors associated with AI, which have been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our
ability to export our technology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a competitive
disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated
with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our products to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or
transfer of our products, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to
provide services such as NVIDIA AI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our cloud service providers and customers to
provide services to their End Customers, even outside China.
Export controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve demand, including in markets
outside China and for our gaming products. Even the possibility of additional export controls has negatively impacted and may in the future
negatively impact demand for our products, benefitting competitors that offer alternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated
changes in the export control rules are likely to impose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially
impacting our business.
Increasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our products or services,
negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls could also lead to excess inventory or cause us
to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral controls are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that
negatively impact the ability of our research and development teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional
export restrictions may not only impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including
China, that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets worldwide, which
could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and our efforts to supply the China market, and if
they conclude that we have violated any applicable law in China or the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox acquisition, this
could subject us to various penalties or restrictions on our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material and adverse
impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG announced export restrictions and export licensing requirements targeting China’s
semiconductor and supercomputing industries. These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as well as software, hardware, equipment, and
technology used to develop, produce, and manufacture certain chips, to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically
impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The
licensing requirements also apply to any future NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance
thresholds, as well as any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of
products, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the second quarter of fiscal
year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain
customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.
On October 17, 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports
to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding
Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The
licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an
ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements
were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products.
Following these export controls, we transitioned some operations, including certain testing, validation, and supply and distribution operations out
of China and Hong Kong. Any future transitions could be costly and time consuming, and adversely affect our research and development and
supply and distribution operations,
43

as well as our revenue, during any such transition period. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer new regulationcompliant solutions, including those for which the USG does not wish to have any advance notice before each shipment. To the extent that a
customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG
will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all. The USG is evaluating license requests in
a non-public process that does not have clear standards or an opportunity for review. The requirements have a disproportionate impact on
NVIDIA and already have disadvantaged and may in the future disadvantage NVIDIA against certain of our competitors who sell products that
are not subject to the new restrictions or may be able to acquire licenses for their products.
Management of these new license and other requirements is complicated and time consuming. Our competitive position has been harmed, and
our competitive position and future results may be further harmed, over the long-term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls,
including further expansion of the geographic, customer, or product scope of the controls, if customers purchase product from competitors, if
customers develop their own internal solution, if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligations, if the USG
does not grant licenses in a timely manner or denies licenses to significant customers, or if we incur significant transition costs. Even if the USG
grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be temporary or impose burdensome conditions that we cannot or choose not to fulfill. The
licensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-sale technical support
efforts more cumbersome and less certain, and encourage customers in China to pursue alternatives to our products, including semiconductor
suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.
Given the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the export control
rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our
business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to
develop replacement products not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as
other impacted markets, including the Middle East. For example, the USG is seeking to impose conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to
create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for example by requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that would disable or
impair GPUs if certain system or use conditions are detected. The USG has already imposed export controls restricting certain gaming GPUs,
and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming products, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution
chain and negatively impact sales of such products to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. Export controls may disrupt our
supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which are warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls
restricting our ability to sell datacenter GPUs may also negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our
GPUs. The USG may also impose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of
downstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of our products would likely
have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our competitors that sell chips that are outside the scope
of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already and may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted
regions to “design-out” certain U.S. semiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are
able to serve markets worldwide. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may negatively impact demand for our products and services
not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase
the risk of investing in U.S. advanced semiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new
unilateral export controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, which would be less
likely to be restricted by U.S. controls.
Additionally, restrictions imposed by the Chinese government on the duration of gaming activities and access to games may adversely affect our
Gaming revenue, and increased oversight of digital platform companies may adversely affect our Data Center revenue. The Chinese
government may impose restrictions on the sale to certain End Customers of our products, or any products containing components made by our
partners and suppliers. For example, the Chinese government announced restrictions relating to certain sales of products containing certain
products made by Micron, a supplier of ours. Further restrictions on our products or the products of our suppliers could negatively impact our
business and financial results.
44

Finally, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable supply from our overseas partners, especially in Taiwan. Any new
restrictions that negatively impact our ability to receive supply of components, parts, or services from Taiwan, would negatively impact our
business and financial results.
Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI in our offerings, may result in reputational or financial harm
and liability.
Concerns relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our products and services may result in reputational or
financial harm and liability and may cause us to incur costs to resolve such issues. We are increasingly building AI capabilities into many of our
products and services, and we also offer stand-alone AI applications. AI poses emerging legal, social, and ethical issues and presents risks and
challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived
or actual impact on society, such as AI solutions that have unintended consequences or are controversial because of their impact on human
rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, or if we are unable to develop effective internal policies and
frameworks relating to the responsible development and use of AI models and systems offered through our sales channels, we may experience
brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Complying with multiple regulations from different jurisdictions related to AI could
increase our cost of doing business, may change the way that we operate in certain jurisdictions, or may impede our ability to offer certain
products and services in certain jurisdictions if we are unable to comply with regulations. Compliance with government regulation of AI, including
under proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union as well as under any U.S. regulation adopted in response to
the Biden administration’s Executive Order on AI, may also increase the cost of related research and development, and create additional
reporting and/or transparency requirements. For example, regulation adopted in response to the Executive Order on AI could require us to notify
the USG of certain safety test results and other information. Furthermore, changes in AI-related regulation could disproportionately impact and
disadvantage us and require us to change our business practices, which may negatively impact our financial results. Our failure to address
concerns and regulation relating to the responsible use of AI by us or others could undermine public confidence in AI and slow adoption of AI in
our products and services or cause reputational or financial harm.
